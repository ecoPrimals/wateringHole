## Spore Taxonomy

The ecoPrimals ecosystem defines three spore deployment classes for
portable media. Each builds on the previous:

### ColdSpore

A static, read-mostly artifact on USB. biomeOS detects the
`.biomeos-spore` marker and can orchestrate the contents, but the
spore itself does not self-update. Like a seed in cold storage.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Marker | `.biomeos-spore` |
| Entry point | `spore` (symlink → `bin/litho`) |
| Data | Frozen (BLAKE3-anchored at build time) |
| Self-update | No |
| Provenance | None (no validation trail) |
| Example | guideStone USB without runtime |

### LiveSpore

ColdSpore plus provenance tracking and data refresh capability. The
artifact accumulates an append-only trail of where it has been
validated. Like a seed that has germinated.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Marker | `.biomeos-spore` |
| Entry point | `spore` (symlink → `bin/litho`) |
| Data | Refreshable via `./refresh` (re-fetches sources, re-computes BLAKE3) |
| Self-update | Data only (binaries frozen) |
| Provenance | `liveSpore.json` — append-only validation journal |
| Example | guideStone USB with `liveSpore.json` tracking |

### lithoSpore (Hypogeal Cotyledon)

A LiveSpore that carries its own **food supply** — embedded Python
runtime, all LTEE module data bundles, litho-core Rust ecoBins, and
Foundation targets. The spore can validate independently of any
network or host system beyond a Linux kernel.

The botanical metaphor: a **hypogeal cotyledon** is a seed leaf that
stays underground, nourishing the seedling until it can
photosynthesize. The USB's bundled data and runtime are the cotyledon
— persistent, not consumed, providing sustenance until the spore
connects to NUCLEUS for full compute capability.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Marker | `.biomeos-spore` |
| Entry point | `spore` → `validate` (all symlinks to `bin/litho`, argv[0] dispatch) |
| Data | Refreshable + bundled (7 LTEE data bundles, Foundation targets) |
| Runtime | Embedded Python (`python-build-standalone` or equivalent) |
| Binaries | Single `litho` binary (musl-static, 5.1 MB) — unified CLI, in-process module execution |
| Self-update | Data (`./refresh`) + binaries via `litho fetch` |
| Provenance | `liveSpore.json` — append-only, BLAKE3-hashed hostnames |
| Example | Full CATHEDRAL USB on ironGate |

## Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Standalone (no network)

The USB is plugged into any Linux machine with no network. The
`validate` entry point detects the absence of primal IPC and falls
back to Tier 1: Python-only validation using the embedded runtime
and bundled data.

```bash
./validate                  # Tier 1: Python, bundled data
./validate --tier 1         # Force Tier 1 even if primals available
```

Results append to `liveSpore.json`. Pre-rendered notebooks in
`notebooks/` provide visual results without Jupyter.

### Mode 2: LAN-connected (ironGate)

The USB is plugged into a gate on the NUCLEUS LAN. litho-core's
`discovery.rs` finds primals via environment variables or UDS
filesystem convention. Validation escalates to Tier 2: Rust ecoBins
calling toadStool, barraCuda, and the provenance trio via Unix
sockets.

```bash
./validate                  # Auto-detects Tier 2 via discovery
./validate --tier 2         # Force Tier 2 (fails if primals absent)
```

### Mode 3: Geo-delocalized (remote gate via cellMembrane)

The USB is plugged into a remote gate (friend's house, family member's
machine). Primal IPC routes through Songbird TURN via the cellMembrane
relay at 157.230.3.183:3478. The discovery chain extends:

```
env var ($TOADSTOOL_PORT) → UDS socket → Songbird TURN relay → None
```

```bash
export SONGBIRD_TURN_SERVER=157.230.3.183:3478
./validate                  # Tier 2 via TURN relay
```

All relay traffic is BTSP-encrypted. The cellMembrane sees only opaque
bytes. The remote gate's `liveSpore.json` entry records the geographic
context (BLAKE3-hashed hostname) without leaking PII.

---

## Provenance Trail (liveSpore.json)

Each `./validate` run appends a JSON entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-14T14:30:00Z",
  "hostname_hash": "blake3(hostname)",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "os": "linux",
  "tier_reached": 2,
  "modules_passed": 7,
  "modules_total": 7,
  "runtime_ms": 342000,
  "discovery_path": "uds",
  "turn_relay": null
}
```

Geo-delocalized runs include `"turn_relay": "157.230.3.183:3478"` and
`"discovery_path": "turn"` to record the relay path.

No PII is stored. The hostname is BLAKE3-hashed. The artifact
accumulates a provenance trail of where it has been and what it proved
-- publishable on sporePrint as auditable journal entries.

---

## sporePrint Return Path

The liveSpore provenance trail feeds back into the sporePrint
publishing pipeline:

```
USB ./validate at gate (local or remote)
  ├── liveSpore.json appended (provenance entry)
  ├── Foundation targets marked validated
  │
  └── Spring absorbs results
      ├── expected_values.json updated
      ├── notify-sporeprint.yml fires repository_dispatch
      ├── sporePrint auto-refresh.yml runs nbconvert
      └── Zola renders to primals.eco
```

Each validation at a different gate and architecture strengthens the
stadial evidence for interstadial exit. Cross-hardware validation of
Foundation threads (AMD at strandGate, NVIDIA at biomeGate, CPU-only
at remote gates) becomes publishable, auditable proof.

---

## Relationship to Other Deployment Classes

```
NUCLEUS     (full primal composition — gate, all atomics + Squirrel)
  ↓
Niche       (biomeOS deploy graph — selected primals, BYOB composition)
  ↓
fieldMouse  (minimal atomic/chimera — embedded, sensor, edge, no biomeOS)
  ↓
lithoSpore  (hypogeal cotyledon — self-contained USB with food + root)
  ↓
ColdSpore   (static artifact — frozen data, no runtime, no provenance)
```

The lithoSpore USB sits between fieldMouse (which requires a running
host system) and ColdSpore (which requires external orchestration).
It is the most portable deployment: a USB that validates science
anywhere there is a Linux kernel.

---

## SoloKey Witness (Future)

Both ironGate and eastGate have SoloKey 2 devices plugged in. When
BearDog FIDO2/CTAP2 integration ships, the `liveSpore.json` provenance
entry can include a hardware witness signature:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "hostname_hash": "...",
  "solokey_witness": {
    "attestation": "fido2-assertion-base64",
    "key_id": "solokey-credential-id"
  }
}
```

This proves physical human presence at the gate during validation --
a stronger provenance claim than software-only timestamping.
