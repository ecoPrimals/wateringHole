# Protocol Negotiation Specification (G65)

**Date**: Aug 6, 2026 | **Wave**: 156k | **Author**: eastGate overwatch
**Status**: REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION in squirrel — ecosystem standard pending adoption
**Origin**: squirrel (first primal) evolved this pattern independently; formalized as G65

---

## Overview

Protocol negotiation enables a primal to serve multiple RPC protocols on a
**single UDS socket**. The client announces which protocols it supports; the
server selects the best mutual match. If no negotiation occurs, JSON-RPC is
assumed (full backward compatibility).

This replaces the C2 dual-socket pattern (`.sock` + `.tarpc.sock`) as the
long-term architecture. C2 was a necessary stepping stone to deploy tarpc
listeners across the ecosystem. G65 unifies them back to a single socket
with protocol intelligence at connection time.

## Evolutionary Arc

| Phase | Pattern | Sockets per primal | Status |
|-------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | JSON-RPC only | 1 (`.sock`) | COMPLETE — all 15 primals |
| **Phase 2 (C2)** | Dual-socket | 2 (`.sock` + `.tarpc.sock`) | 13/15 shipped |
| **Phase 3 (G65)** | Protocol negotiation | 1 (`.sock`) | squirrel reference impl |

Phase 2 proved tarpc works at scale and gave cellMembrane concrete discovery
targets. Phase 3 eliminates the socket proliferation while preserving all
tarpc benefits.

## Wire Protocol

### Connection Handshake

```text
Client → Server: "PROTOCOLS: tarpc,jsonrpc\n"
Server → Client: "PROTOCOL: tarpc\n"
[Connection proceeds in selected protocol]
```

The negotiation is a **single round-trip** prepended to the connection. After
selection, the socket operates exclusively in the chosen protocol for the
lifetime of that connection.

### Backward Compatibility

If the first bytes from the client are NOT a `PROTOCOLS:` line, the server
assumes JSON-RPC. This means:

- Existing JSON-RPC clients work with **zero changes**
- Existing BTSP riboCipher-prefixed connections work unchanged
- Only clients that want tarpc need to send the negotiation line

The server uses a **100ms timeout** on the first line read. If no negotiation
line arrives within that window, the connection proceeds as JSON-RPC.

### Protocol Names

| Name | Wire value | Serialization | Use case |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| `jsonrpc` | `"jsonrpc"` | serde_json | Default, diagnostics, browser, cross-language |
| `tarpc` | `"tarpc"` | bincode 2.x | Performance, type-safe, intra-gate composition |

Future protocols (e.g., `ribocipher-encrypted`, `quic`) extend the enum
without changing the negotiation wire format.

### Selection Algorithm

```rust
fn select_protocol(
    client_supported: &[IpcProtocol],
    server_supported: &[IpcProtocol],
) -> IpcProtocol {
    for client_proto in client_supported {
        if server_supported.contains(client_proto) {
            return *client_proto;
        }
    }
    IpcProtocol::JsonRpc // fallback — always supported
}
```

Client preference order wins. If the client sends `tarpc,jsonrpc` and the
server supports both, tarpc is selected. If the server only supports
JSON-RPC, the client gracefully falls back.

## Why This Is Better Than Dual-Socket

### 1. Socket Proliferation

C2 doubles the file descriptors per NUCLEUS gate:
- 15 primals × 2 sockets = 30 sockets in `/run/membrane/`
- 30 systemd `ExecStart` entries, 30 health checks, 30 cellMembrane registry entries

G65 returns to 15 sockets with no capability loss.

### 2. Protocol Transparency for Callers

With C2, the caller must decide which socket to connect to **before** the
call. This leaks protocol awareness into every consumer:

```rust
// C2 — caller decides protocol
let path = if use_tarpc {
    "/run/membrane/nestgate.tarpc.sock"
} else {
    "/run/membrane/nestgate.sock"
};
```

With G65, the caller just connects and asks for what it wants:

```rust
// G65 — server decides best match
let stream = UnixStream::connect("/run/membrane/nestgate.sock").await?;
let protocol = negotiate_client(&mut stream, vec![Tarpc, JsonRpc]).await?;
```

### 3. Graceful Capability Discovery

When a primal adds tarpc support for new methods, C2 requires clients to
know about the `.tarpc.sock` path. G65 discovers capabilities at connection
time — if the server gained tarpc since last call, the client auto-upgrades.

### 4. songBird Routing

songBird mesh routing becomes protocol-transparent. When routing cross-gate
calls, songBird can negotiate tarpc on high-bandwidth 10G links and fall
back to JSON-RPC on constrained links, without the caller knowing.

### 5. Future Protocols

The negotiation format is extensible. Adding a third protocol (QUIC,
encrypted riboCipher, etc.) requires no new socket files — just an
additional entry in the `PROTOCOLS:` line. Dual-socket scales linearly
(3 sockets, 4 sockets...); negotiation stays at 1.

---

## Relationship to BTSP and riboCipher

The BTSP transport signal (`0xEC 0x01`) is a byte-level protocol prefix
used for the existing JSON-RPC UDS framing. Protocol negotiation operates
at a higher layer — it's a text-line exchange that precedes the BTSP
framing. They compose cleanly:

```text
[TCP/UDS connect]
  → Protocol negotiation (text lines, optional)
    → BTSP signal bytes (per-message framing)
      → JSON-RPC or tarpc payload
```

When a connection negotiates tarpc, the BTSP signal is skipped — tarpc
uses its own bincode framing directly on the stream.

---

## Adoption Plan

### Phase 1: Extract to Shared Crate

squirrel's `protocol_negotiation.rs` (432 lines, fully tested) becomes
the reference. Extract into a shared location accessible to all primals:

- **Option A**: `sourDough` (standards holder, nascent spawning primal)
  publishes the negotiation crate as part of its reference implementation
- **Option B**: `cellMembrane` absorbs the negotiation logic into its
  service registry, making it available to all primals via membrane types

### Phase 2: Primal Adoption

Each primal adds protocol negotiation to its existing UDS listener.
Convergent evolution — each team implements on their own timeline:

1. Add negotiation to the JSON-RPC socket listener (server side)
2. The existing tarpc server logic (from C2) handles tarpc connections
3. Remove the separate `.tarpc.sock` listener once negotiation is stable
4. cellMembrane registry drops `has_tarpc` field — all sockets negotiate

### Phase 3: cellMembrane Discovery Evolution

cellMembrane evolves from socket-path tracking to capability negotiation:

- `MembraneService` tracks `supported_protocols: Vec<IpcProtocol>`
  instead of `has_tarpc: bool`
- Health sweep connects once, negotiates, and reports protocol capabilities
- systemd units return to single `ExecStart` with one socket path

### Phase 4: songBird Cross-Gate Negotiation

songBird mesh relay gains protocol negotiation for inter-gate calls.
Cross-gate tarpc elevation becomes automatic — no configuration needed.

## Reference Implementation

squirrel `crates/main/src/rpc/`:

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `protocol_negotiation.rs` | 432 | Core negotiation logic (client + server + tests) |
| `protocol.rs` | 215 | `IpcProtocol` enum + wire names |
| `tarpc_server.rs` | 389 | tarpc RPC server (delegates to JSON-RPC handlers) |
| `tarpc_client.rs` | 535 | tarpc RPC client |
| `tarpc_dispatch.rs` | 479 | tarpc method dispatch |
| `tarpc_service.rs` | 726 | `SquirrelRpc` trait definition |
| `tarpc_transport.rs` | 157 | Transport abstraction |
| **Total** | **2,933** | |

The negotiation itself is ~200 lines of logic + ~230 lines of tests. The
rest is squirrel-specific service implementation that each primal replaces
with its own domain methods.

## Interaction with Other Glacial Goals

| Goal | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| **G64** (Cephalization) | G65 is Phase 3 of G64's dual-protocol convergence |
| **G60** (Federated CAS) | Protocol negotiation enables tarpc for high-throughput CAS ops |
| **G61** (Compute Memoization) | tarpc binary framing eliminates serde overhead for config transfer |
| **G56** (Neural API) | biomeOS capability routing can delegate protocol selection to negotiation |

*G65 — Protocol Negotiation. Single socket, best protocol, auto-negotiation.
squirrel evolved it first; the ecosystem converges to it as Phase 3 of
cephalization. C2 dual-socket was the stepping stone that proved tarpc
works at scale. G65 is the destination.*
