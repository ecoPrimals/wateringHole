# sporeGate Activation — LAN Periplasm Router

**Hardware**: GMKtec NucBox M6 (Ryzen 7 6800H, 32GB RAM, 2x 2.5G RJ45)
**Role**: Sovereign LAN perimeter — NAT, firewall, DHCP, DNS, VPN, NUCLEUS primals
**Date**: 2026-06-16

## Physical Wiring

```
ATT Gateway LAN port ──RJ45──► sporeGate eth0 (WAN interface)
sporeGate eth1 (LAN interface) ──RJ45──► CRS310 RJ45 port
```

After wiring: CRS310 becomes pure L2 switch. sporeGate handles all L3.

## CRITICAL: WiFi as Out-of-Band Management

**sporeGate MUST keep WiFi enabled and connected at all times.**

Since sporeGate IS the LAN router, any misconfiguration of wired interfaces
locks out all other gates (including eastGate). WiFi provides an out-of-band
fallback so agents can still SSH in and self-heal without physical access.

```bash
# Ensure WiFi stays up even when systemd-networkd manages wired interfaces:
nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<PSK>"
nmcli connection modify "<SSID>" connection.autoconnect yes
nmcli connection modify "<SSID>" ipv4.route-metric 600
# High route-metric ensures WiFi is fallback only (wired preferred for data)
```

**Biological analogy**: WiFi = flagellar emergency signaling — when the cell wall
(wired periplasm) is compromised, the organism retains a secondary communication path.

## Step 1: OS Install (if not already Linux)

Pop!_OS or Ubuntu Server 24.04. Either works. Key: systemd-networkd for networking.

---

## Step 2: Identify NICs

```bash
ip link show
# Find the two 2.5G interfaces (likely enp1s0, enp2s0 or similar)
# Label them: WAN (facing ATT) and LAN (facing CRS310)
```

---

## Step 3: Network Configuration

Create `/etc/systemd/network/10-wan.network`:
```ini
[Match]
Name=enp1s0

[Network]
DHCP=yes

[DHCPv4]
UseDNS=no
UseRoutes=yes
```

Create `/etc/systemd/network/20-lan.network`:
```ini
[Match]
Name=enp2s0

[Network]
Address=192.168.4.1/22
DHCPServer=yes

[DHCPServer]
PoolOffset=100
PoolSize=150
DNS=192.168.4.1
DefaultLeaseTimeSec=3600
```

Enable:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager  # if present
```

---

## Step 4: IP Forwarding

```bash
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-router.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-router.conf
```

---

## Step 5: NAT (nftables)

Create `/etc/nftables.conf`:
```
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

flush ruleset

table ip filter {
    chain input {
        type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;
        iif "lo" accept
        ct state established,related accept
        iifname "enp2s0" accept
        icmp type echo-request accept
        tcp dport 22 accept
        drop
    }

    chain forward {
        type filter hook forward priority 0; policy accept;
        ct state established,related accept
        iifname "enp2s0" accept
        drop
    }

    chain output {
        type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
    }
}

table ip nat {
    chain postrouting {
        type nat hook postrouting priority 100; policy accept;
        oifname "enp1s0" masquerade
    }
}
```

Enable:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nftables
```

---

## Step 6: DNS (dnsmasq)

```bash
sudo apt install dnsmasq
```

`/etc/dnsmasq.conf`:
```
interface=enp2s0
bind-interfaces
listen-address=192.168.4.1
no-dhcp-interface=enp2s0
server=1.1.1.1
server=8.8.8.8
cache-size=1000
```

(DHCP is handled by systemd-networkd above, dnsmasq just does DNS caching.)

---

## Step 7: CRS310 Reconfiguration

After sporeGate is working as the gateway:
1. Access CRS310 WebFig (currently at 192.168.4.1 — will change)
2. Remove all L3 config (IP addresses, DHCP server, NAT rules, firewall)
3. Set to bridge mode (all ports in one bridge, no routing)
4. Assign management IP: 192.168.4.2/22 (static, for WebFig access)
5. Result: CRS310 is a pure 10G/2.5G switch

---

## Step 8: Verify

```bash
# From any LAN device (eastGate, fieldGate):
ping 192.168.4.1        # sporeGate (should be <1ms)
ping 8.8.8.8            # internet via sporeGate NAT
ssh sporegate           # SSH to sporeGate
dig google.com @192.168.4.1  # DNS resolution
```

---

## Step 9: NUCLEUS Deployment (after routing is stable)

Once routing is proven stable for 24h:
```bash
# On sporeGate:
mkdir -p ~/Development/ecoPrimals
# Clone from Forgejo (sovereign) or GitHub
git clone ssh://git@git.primals.eco:2222/ecoPrimals/cellMembrane.git ~/Development/ecoPrimals/gardens/cellMembrane
# Build or fetch membrane binary
# Run gate.bootstrap sporeGate
```

Primals for sporeGate:
- bearDog (WireGuard key management)
- skunkBat (network monitoring)
- songBird (mesh hub / WAN relay)
- loamSpine (audit trail)

---

## Rollback

If anything breaks, unplug sporeGate and plug CRS310 directly back to ATT.
All devices will get DHCP from CRS310 again (it's still configured as router until you strip its L3).
