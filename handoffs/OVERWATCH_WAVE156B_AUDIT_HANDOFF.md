# Overwatch Audit Handoff — Wave 155q/156b

**Date**: Aug 3, 2026 PM | **Wave**: 155q/156b | **From**: eastGate overwatch
**Purpose**: Current state summary, team handoffs, gaps for upstream audit.

## Ecosystem Posture

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **P0/P1/P2** | ZERO |
| **NUCLEUS gates** | 11 online (eastGate, westGate, blueGate, strandGate, southGate, sporeGate, flockGate, golgiBody, biomeGate, ironGate, redGate) |
| **Total tests** | 121,000+ across 15 primals + 9 springs |
| **Data** | 519 GB / 130+ datasets / 17+ domains on westGate ZFS |
| **sporePrint** | 338 pages, 25 sections, live at sporeprint.primals.eco |
| **esotericWebb** | V26, 471 tests, 8/9 primals zero-config on ironGate |

## Team Handoffs

### sporeGate — nestgate.io Data Identity Surface

**Handoff doc**: `handoffs/SPOREGATE_NESTGATE_IO_DATA_ROUTING.md`

The Data Braids section at `/data/` is live on sporePrint. sporeGate needs to:
1. Point nestgate.io DNS to golgi (157.230.3.183)
2. Configure Caddy — redirect or reverse proxy to sporePrint `/data/` pages
3. The CAS data on westGate should become a living database queryable via nestgate.io

The user can then discover datasets, see inline provenance braids, and
download pseudoSpores — all via nestgate.io as the data identity surface.

### hotSpring — Plaquette Normalization (BLOCKS arXiv)

**Handoff doc**: `handoffs/HOTSPRING_RUNG1_EXPERIMENT_QUEUE.md`

arXiv submission is BLOCKED on the ×4 plaquette normalization discrepancy.
The 4-step diagnostic protocol is documented. Must resolve before any
long production campaigns.

### Node Atomic — pseudoSpore v1.0.0-rung1

Once plaquette normalization resolves and Rung 1 experiments complete:
- Freeze pseudoSpore format
- Mint v1.0.0-rung1 signed release

### All Teams — westGate CAS as Living Database

The vision: westGate CAS data is not static files — it's a living,
queryable database. Teams contribute data, it flows through the
Provenance Trio, and becomes browsable via nestgate.io. The Data Braids
pages on sporePrint are the current read-only view. Next steps:

1. sporeGate configures nestgate.io routing
2. nestGate CAS API enables programmatic access to object hashes
3. sweetGrass braid API enables provenance queries
4. sporePrint regenerates pages from live CAS/braid state (not static markdown)

## Gaps Found for Upstream Teams

### High Priority

| Gap | Owner | Detail |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **nestgate.io DNS not routed** | sporeGate | DNS + Caddy config needed |
| **Plaquette ×4 normalization** | hotSpring | BLOCKS arXiv submission |
| **pseudoSpore bundles empty** | westGate/lithoSpore | Bundle `data/` dirs have provenance but no actual files |
| **6 validate.sh copies identical** | sporePrint | Deduplicate to single template |
| **strandGate DNS dead** | sporeGate | ORTHOGONAL_DIMENSIONS G29 — may still be open |

### Medium Priority

| Gap | Owner | Detail |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **CHANGELOG.md lag** | sporePrint | Was 3 weeks behind EVOLUTION_QUEUE — now caught up to 3.24.0 |
| **GATE_SETUP_STANDARD.md stale** | operations | Says "westGate pending" — westGate has 519 GB operational |
| **SPOREPRINT_BLURB.md stale data** | overwatch | Was 356 GB / 32 datasets — updated to 519 GB / 130+ |
| **Publication LATTICE_QCD has TODOs** | hotSpring | strandGate Aug 2-3 AARs claim sections filled — file needs refresh |
| **Commits pending on tideGlass, airSpring** | westGate teams | "cascade push" still needed |

### Low Priority / Cleanup

| Gap | Owner | Detail |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **static/content-manifest.toml** | sporePrint | Was stale duplicate — synced |
| **GitHub Pages trailing shadow** | sporePrint | deploy.yml still active — archive when ready |
| **STANDARDS_AND_EXPECTATIONS.md** | overwatch | Last updated Wave 150s (Jul 21) |
| **eastGate heads file** | heads/ | Updated Jul 27 vs ironGate Aug 3 |

## What sporePrint Just Shipped

1. **Inline braids** — W3C PROV-O JSON-LD on 22 datasets across 13 domain pages
2. **3 stubs → full pages** — cancer-genomics, disease-ontology, genomic-reference
3. **Transplant page** — pseudoSpore/lithoSpore concept for PIs
4. **"Data" nav item** — between pseudoSpore and Lab
5. **Catalog synced** — 519 GB / 130+ datasets / 17+ domains everywhere
6. **Root docs refreshed** — README, CONTEXT, CONTENT_MAP, CHANGELOG updated
7. **1.1 GB cleaned** — cargo target + zola public + stale manifest

*Wave 155q/156b clean. ZERO P0/P1/P2. overwatch can begin handing off
to other teams. The CAS data on westGate is the living database —
nestgate.io is the front door sporeGate needs to wire up.*
