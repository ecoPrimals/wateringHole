# primalSpring v0.9.3 — Live Validation GAP-MATRIX + Primal Work Items

**Date**: April 7, 2026  
**From**: primalSpring (coordination spring)  
**To**: biomeOS team, BearDog team, Songbird team, NestGate team, provenance trio teams, Squirrel team, ToadStool team, downstream springs  
**Phase**: 26 — Mixed Composition + Live Validation Matrix

---

## Context

primalSpring ran three live validation runs against Eastgate, probing each primal
through direct JSON-RPC IPC and through the biomeOS Neural API. The particle
model (Tower=electron, Node=proton, Nest=neutron) provides the compositional
framework. Three runs tracked biomeOS evolution from v2.81 → v2.92 → v2.93.

**Run 3 (biomeOS v2.93)**: 52 capabilities auto-discovered from 2 primals.
7 of 9 capability.call methods forwarded end-to-end through Neural API.
GAP-MATRIX-01, 01b, 07 all RESOLVED. New medium/low issues identified.

This handoff assigns remaining work to each primal team based on the gaps found.

## biomeOS Team — GAP-MATRIX-07b + GAP-MATRIX-08 + GAP-MATRIX-02 (Medium + Low)

### ~~GAP-MATRIX-01~~ RESOLVED (v2.93) + ~~GAP-MATRIX-01b~~ RESOLVED (v2.93) + ~~GAP-MATRIX-07~~ RESOLVED (v2.93)

biomeOS v2.93 (commit `13ca2328`) resolved all three critical/medium gaps:
- **Format E parser** added for BearDog's `provided_capabilities` wire format → 38 BearDog capabilities now registered
- **`unix://` URI scheme** handled in `TransportEndpoint::parse()` → proxy forwarding works end-to-end
- Combined: **52 capabilities from 2 primals**, 7/9 capability.call tests pass

### GAP-MATRIX-07b (Medium, NEW): Proxy Error Propagation

**Problem**: When a primal returns a JSON-RPC error response (e.g., parameter
validation `-32601`), biomeOS reports "Failed to forward" instead of propagating
the primal's actual error back. The proxy conflates transport failure with
application-level errors.

**Evidence**: `crypto.verify_ed25519` with wrong params → BearDog returns
`-32601: Missing required parameter: public_key` → Neural API returns
`Failed to forward crypto.verify_ed25519 to unix:///...`

**Impact**: Callers cannot distinguish between primal being unreachable vs
primal rejecting the request. Methods with correct params work fine.

**Recommended Fix**: In the forwarding path, check if the primal socket returned
a valid JSON-RPC response (even if it's an error response). Only report "Failed
to forward" for transport-level failures (connection refused, timeout).

### GAP-MATRIX-08 (Low, NEW): Self-Discovery Routing Pollution

**Problem**: Neural API discovers its own socket ~20s after startup during a
re-scan sweep, registering itself as a capability provider for all domains.

**Impact**: Routing table has duplicate `neural @` entries. No functional
breakage — correct primal is still `primary_endpoint`.

**Recommended Fix**: Exclude the Neural API's own socket path from
auto-discovery scans.

### GAP-MATRIX-02: Graph Parser (Medium, PARTIAL)

biomeOS v2.93 added `#[serde(default)]` to `GraphDefinition.name/version`.
The graph loader path now parses TOML successfully (confirmed via debug logs).
However, the bootstrap code path still fails on `tower_atomic_bootstrap.toml`
and `graph.list` returns empty despite parsing success.

**Remaining**: Unify bootstrap parser with graph loader, or surface parsed
graphs in the `graph.list` endpoint.

## Songbird Team — GAP-MATRIX-03 (Low) + Capability Method Gap

### TLS 1.3 Cipher Suite Compatibility (GAP-MATRIX-03)

**Problem**: Some HTTPS targets fail TLS handshake through Songbird (httpbin.org)
while others succeed (ifconfig.me). The custom TLS 1.3 stack may not support
all cipher suites required by common servers.

**Evidence**:
```
ifconfig.me → HTTP 200 (283ms) ✓
httpbin.org → TLS handshake failure ✗
```

**Recommended Fix**: Ensure support for at minimum:
- `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
- `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
- `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

### Capability Advertisement vs Method Implementation

**Problem**: Songbird lists domain descriptors in `capabilities.list` (e.g.,
`network.discovery`, `network.federation`, `ipc.jsonrpc`) but returns "unknown
JSON-RPC method" when these are called directly. These are capability markers,
not method endpoints.

**Evidence**:
```
capabilities.list → ["network.discovery", "ipc.jsonrpc", ...]  ✓
method: "network.discovery" → "unknown JSON-RPC method"  ✗
```

**Impact**: biomeOS forwards the exact capability name as a JSON-RPC method.
Songbird rejects it because it doesn't implement that method.

**Options**:
1. Implement advertised capability names as callable JSON-RPC methods
2. Extend `capabilities.list` response to include actual method names
3. Provide a `method_info` response format so biomeOS can map names

---

## NestGate Team — GAP-MATRIX-04 (Medium)

### IPC Model Divergence

**Problem**: NestGate uses HTTP REST, not JSON-RPC over UDS. Every other primal
(BearDog, Songbird, Squirrel, biomeOS, primalSpring) uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over
Unix domain sockets. NestGate's `--help` has historically been unstable.

**Impact**: NestGate cannot be probed with the same `socat`/`PrimalClient` tools
used for all other primals. Integration requires a separate HTTP bridge.

**Options**:
1. **Add JSON-RPC over UDS mode** to NestGate alongside HTTP REST
2. **Build a thin bridge primal** (`nestgate-bridge`) that translates JSON-RPC ↔ HTTP
3. **Document the HTTP REST API** so primalSpring can probe it directly

Option 1 is preferred for ecosystem consistency.

## Provenance Trio Teams — GAP-MATRIX-05 (Medium)

### rhizoCrypt, loamSpine, sweetGrass Not Live-Tested

**Problem**: These primals were not running during the live validation matrix.
Their L0 routing through Neural API and L1 composition patterns are
structural-only (validated by primalSpring Rust code, not live IPC).

**Work**:
1. Confirm each primal starts and creates a socket
2. Verify `health.liveness` responds correctly
3. Verify `capabilities.list` returns capabilities in a format biomeOS can parse
4. Report any CLI flags needed for socket creation

Note: The provenance trio's `plasmidBin` binaries were updated April 7.

---

## Squirrel Team — GAP-MATRIX-05 (Medium)

### Squirrel Not Live-Tested

**Problem**: Squirrel uses abstract sockets (`@squirrel`) which biomeOS routes
to filesystem sockets. Not tested in this validation run.

**Work**:
1. Confirm Squirrel starts and advertises capabilities
2. Verify abstract socket is discoverable by biomeOS
3. Test `ai.health` and `capabilities.list` through Neural API

---

## ToadStool Team — GAP-MATRIX-05 (Medium)

### ToadStool Not Live-Tested

**Problem**: ToadStool is CLI-only (no persistent server mode). Not tested
in this validation run.

**Work**:
1. If a server/daemon mode exists, document the CLI flags
2. Verify `capabilities.list` returns compute capabilities
3. Test GPU capability routing through Neural API

---

## BearDog Team — Maintenance Only

BearDog passed all live probes through Neural API (biomeOS v2.93). No action items.

**Validated end-to-end through Neural API**:
- `health.liveness` ✓ (v0.9.0)
- `crypto.sign_ed25519` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → signature)
- `crypto.blake3_hash` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → hash)
- `crypto.hmac_sha256` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → HMAC)
- `security.evaluate` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → trust evaluation)
- `trust.evaluate` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → trust evaluation)
- `tls.derive_secrets` ✓ (Neural API → BearDog → key derivation)
- `capabilities.list` ✓ (38 capabilities parsed via Format E)
