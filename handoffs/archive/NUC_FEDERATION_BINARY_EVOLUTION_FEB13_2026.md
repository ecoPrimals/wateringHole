# NUC Federation & Binary Evolution Handoff
**Date**: February 13, 2026
**Session Focus**: LiveSpore Deployment to NUC, Binary Format Discovery

---

## Summary

Successfully deployed biomeOS NUCLEUS to a second computer (NUC/mini-PC) via LiveSpore USB, establishing the first multi-computer federated cluster. Discovered critical binary format requirements for cross-system deployment.

---

## Achievements

### 1. NUC Integration
- **Hardware**: Ryzen 5 6600H, 28GB RAM, Pop!_OS 22.04
- **IP**: 192.0.2.190 (WiFi)
- **SSH Access**: Configured passwordless (`ssh nuc`)
- **Deployment**: Gen 2 child of Tower via livespore-alpha

### 2. NUCLEUS Complete on NUC
All 5 primals verified working:

| Atomic | Primal | Version | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Tower | BearDog | 0.9.0 | ✅ healthy |
| Tower | Songbird | 0.1.0 | ✅ healthy |
| Node | Toadstool | 0.1.0 | ✅ working |
| Node | Squirrel | 0.1.0 | ✅ working |
| Nest | NestGate | 2.1.0 | ✅ healthy (fixed) |

### 3. Federation Verified
- Same family ID: `8ff3b864a4bc589a`
- BirdSong encryption keys match
- Cross-node JSON-RPC via SSH working
- Covalent bond: Tower ↔ NUC established

## Binary Format Evolution

### Discovery: PIE vs Static Linking

During NUC deployment, NestGate segfaulted immediately. Root cause analysis revealed:

**Binary Format Comparison:**
```
WORKING (on modern Linux with ASLR):
  beardog:   ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, dynamically linked
  songbird:  ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, dynamically linked
  toadstool: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, static-pie linked
  squirrel:  ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, static-pie linked
  
BROKEN:
  nestgate:  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, statically linked (NOT pie)
```

### Root Cause
The LiveSpore contained NestGate built with `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target, which produces:
- `statically linked` binary (no dynamic linker)
- **NOT** Position Independent Executable (PIE)

Modern Linux distributions enforce ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) which requires PIE binaries. Non-PIE static binaries can segfault on load.

### Solution
Replaced with PIE-enabled binary from `phase1/nestgate/target/release/nestgate`:
- `pie executable, dynamically linked`
- Works on ASLR-enabled systems

### Build Target Matrix

| Target | PIE | Dynamic | ASLR Safe | Use Case |
|--------|-----|---------|-----------|----------|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Desktop Linux |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Alpine/containers |
| `--target with -C relocation-model=pie` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Static + ASLR |

### Recommended Build Command
```bash
# For portable static binaries that work everywhere:
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static -C relocation-model=pie" \
  cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

## Files Modified

- `~/.ssh/config` - Added NUC alias
- NUC: `~/.local/bin/*` - All 6 genome binaries
- NUC: `~/.local/share/biomeos/` - Genetics and config

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Binary Format Matters**: musl static != portable. PIE is required for ASLR systems.
2. **Always Test Binaries**: `file` command reveals PIE status before deployment.
3. **SSH Deployment Works**: LiveSpore + SSH is viable for network-based deployment.
4. **NestGate Requires JWT**: Production NestGate needs `NESTGATE_JWT_SECRET` set.

---

## Next Steps

1. Update LiveSpore USBs with PIE-enabled NestGate
2. Add binary format validation to genome build pipeline
3. Test distributed work between Tower and NUC
4. Document build targets in specs

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check NUC status
ssh nuc 'pgrep -la biomeos; pgrep -la nestgate'

# Test NUC beardog
ssh nuc 'echo "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"health\",\"id\":1}" | timeout 3 nc -U /run/user/1000/biomeos/beardog-8ff3b864a4bc589a.sock'

# Check binary format
file /path/to/binary  # Look for "pie executable"
```
