# ecoPrimals Ecosystem Blurb — Wave 133e

**Date**: Jul 7, 2026 11:05 EDT | **Wave**: 133e | **From**: eastGate overwatch
**Posture**: **ECOSYSTEM STANDARDS REFRESHED — stale docs updated, resolved work archived, publication rubric integrated**
Housekeeping wave: ecosystem standards (GLACIAL, SOVEREIGNTY, TOPOLOGY) brought to 133d. songBird drawbridge committed. Wave plan shaped through 135+.

---

## Ecosystem State

```
✅ 13/13 primals CONVERGED — zero CI workarounds, zero code debt
✅ 30/30 ecobins in pepti (15 x86_64 + 15 aarch64) — 4-5 stale, pending rebuild
✅ 1098 tests GREEN, 125 scenarios, 0 fail (composition subtypes landed)
✅ LAN mesh: eastGate ↔ ironGate ↔ southGate (Omada 10G backbone)
✅ WAN mesh: flockGate ↔ sporeGate (WireGuard 10.13.37.x, 72ms p50)
✅ Mobile: grapheneGate 12/13 TCP-only (13/13 after pepti rebuild)
✅ Sovereignty: S1-S4 ALL GRADUATED on inner membrane
✅ golgi: sporePrint NUCLEUS (212 pages) + thin edge relay + freshness auto-publishing
✅ 7/7 stadial criteria CLEAR — all operational proof exercises are validation, not blockers
✅ SHOW_HN publication rubric established (28 criteria, 4 categories)
```

**This wave**: Standards housekeeping + wave plan. songBird drawbridge auto-advertisement committed. 2 superseded handoffs archived. GLACIAL, SOVEREIGNTY, TOPOLOGY docs updated to 133d. Wave plan shaped: 134a (deploy convergence), 134b (sovereignty sprint), 135+ (SHOW_HN readiness).

## WAVE PLAN: 134a → 135+

### Wave 134a — Pepti Rebuild + Capability Convergence

**Goal**: WAN-DISPATCH-01 FULL PASS. All gates run converged binaries from pepti.

| # | Item | Owner | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Rebuild pepti: songBird, skunkBat, nestGate, coralReef, sweetGrass | sporeGate CI | **NEXT** — 5 primals need fresh builds |
| 2 | Redeploy songBird on sporeGate from pepti | sporeGate team | After #1 |
| 3 | flockGate re-runs WAN-DISPATCH-01 → target FULL PASS | flockGate | After #2 |
| 4 | grapheneGate 13/13 redeploy from fresh pepti | eastGate | After #1 |
| 5 | Verify composition subtypes match live deployments | projectNUCLEUS | Ongoing |

**Closes**: S-6 (pepti current), S-8 (capability.call cross-gate)
**Posture target**: CAPABILITY CONVERGENCE PROVEN — WAN-DISPATCH-01 FULL PASS

### Wave 134b — Sovereignty Sprint

**Goal**: `primals.eco` served from sovereign infrastructure. bearDog TLS cutover.

| # | Item | Owner | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | bearDog CryptoProvider investigation/fix (rustls-rustcrypto panic, UNIT-DIV-04) | bearDog team | **P1 BLOCKER** for DNS cutover |
| 2 | DNS cutover: `primals.eco` → golgi direct (bearDog ACME) | eastGate overwatch | After #1 |
| 3 | sporePrint NUCLEUS: Caddy → bearDog TLS cutover on golgi | cellMembrane | After #1 — 7-day shadow |
| 4 | strandGate SSH enrollment (physical access, house 2) | eastGate hw | Pending hardware access |

**Closes**: S-10 (sporePrint inner membrane), UNIT-DIV-04
**Posture target**: SOVEREIGNTY DNS CUTOVER — primals.eco on inner membrane

### Wave 135+ — SHOW_HN Readiness Sprint

**Goal**: All 28 rubric criteria targeting PASS. External proof of stadial readiness.

| Category | Items | Key Actions |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Evidence (E) | E-1 through E-7 | Cold clone test, CI badges, Lab links, reproduce guide |
| Narrative (N) | N-1 through N-6 | Title, first comment, criticism responses, comparison table |
| Standards (S) | S-1 through S-10 | Test suite 1000+, pepti current, cross-gate dispatch, sporePrint sovereign |
| Operational (O) | O-1 through O-5 | Karma buildup (3-6 month window), posting date, public clone test |

**Posture target**: SHOW_HN PRE-FLIGHT — all rubric items targeting PASS

---

## TRACK 1: DEPLOY — Pepti + Capability Convergence

**Immediate priority for 134a.** songBird drawbridge auto-advertisement committed (026f6e3e). Pattern documented in `GATEHOUSE_DARKFOREST_STANDARD.md`:

```
SONGBIRD_DRAWBRIDGE_ROUTES=/hub=jupyter,/api=inference
→ songBird auto-registers ["jupyter", "inference"] at startup
→ announces to mesh peers via mesh.capabilities_announce
→ remote gates can capability.call("jupyter") → routed to drawbridge
```

Composition subtypes formalized in projectNUCLEUS:

| Composition | Primals | Gate | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|------|---------|
| **Full NUCLEUS** | All 13 | eastGate, ironGate | Complete sovereign stack |
| **Tower** | bearDog + songBird + skunkBat | grapheneGate, new gates | Minimal secure mesh entry |
| **JupyterHub host** | songBird (drawbridge) + bearDog + biomeOS | ironGate | `lab.primals.eco` via mesh relay |
| **sporePrint host** | petalTongue + nestGate + songBird + bearDog | golgi VPS | Sovereign website with live mesh viz |
| **Cold storage** | nestGate + sweetGrass + rhizoCrypt | westGate | 76TB ZFS CAS archive |
| **Compute dispatch** | toadStool + barraCuda + coralReef + biomeOS | strandGate | GPU compute mesh |

---

## TRACK 2: SOVEREIGN — DNS Cutover + Inner Membrane

**134b target.** bearDog CryptoProvider fix is the gate.

```
CURRENT:
  primals.eco → Cloudflare → Caddy on golgi → sporePrint (212 pages)
  primal.eco  → sovereign (S1-S4 GRADUATED) ✅
  bearDog ACME → BLOCKED (CryptoProvider panic, UNIT-DIV-04)

TARGET (134b):
  primals.eco → golgi VPS → bearDog ACME TLS → petalTongue rendering
  primal.eco  → sovereign ✅ (no change)
  Cloudflare → outer membrane only (acceptable per diderm)
```

Membrane channels: Channel 1 (DNS) LIVE, Channel 2 (TURN) LIVE, Channel 2b (RustDesk) LIVE, Channel 3 (TLS) LIVE via Caddy (bearDog shadow BLOCKED).

---

## TRACK 3: GLACIAL — Stadial Entry + Operational Proof

**All 7 criteria CLEAR.** What remains is operational validation:

| Exercise | Purpose | Wave | Status |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| WAN-DISPATCH-01 FULL PASS | capability.call routes through WAN relay | 134a | Unblocked — songBird evolved |
| strandGate enrollment | 3+ gate mesh enrollment reproducible | 134b | Physical access needed |
| grapheneGate 13/13 | Full mobile NUCLEUS from pepti | 134a | After pepti rebuild |
| Dark-forest re-enable | Full bearDog security posture | 134b+ | After 3+ LAN peers |
| pepti rebuild | CI pipeline → clean binaries, zero workarounds | 134a | NEXT action |

---

## TRACK 4: PUBLICATION — SHOW_HN as External Proof

The SHOW_HN rubric is not a marketing exercise — it IS the glacial proof made external. Every S-category criterion maps to an existing stadial criterion or deployment goal.

**Key linkages**:
- S-6 (pepti current) → 134a pepti rebuild
- S-8 (cross-gate dispatch) → 134a WAN-DISPATCH-01
- S-10 (sporePrint sovereign) → 134b DNS cutover
- E-2 (cold clone) → spring team prep
- O-1 (karma buildup) → 3-6 month window starts now

**Timeline model**: ~3-6 months of karma buildup + content refinement → SHOW_HN submission when all S-category PASS and narrative is sharp. The karma buildup window naturally paces the sovereignty sprint and operational proof exercises.

---

## Physical + Mesh Topology (133e)

```
HARDWARE (physical switching):
  House 1 (CRS310 backbone):  sporeGate, eastGate, northGate, biomeGate(offline)
  House 2 (Omada SX3008F):    ironGate, southGate, strandGate(pending), fieldGate
  Link: 80m 10G AOC trunk between adjacent lots

MESH OVERLAYS:
  Songbird covalent (TCP :7700): eastGate ↔ golgi ↔ ironGate + southGate + grapheneGate
  WireGuard WAN (10.13.37.x):   sporeGate ↔ flockGate (72ms p50, connection pooling active)
  Capability routing:            PARTIAL — http.request proven, jupyter pending pepti rebuild
```
