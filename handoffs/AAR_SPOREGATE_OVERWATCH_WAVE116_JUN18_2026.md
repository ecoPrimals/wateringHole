# AAR — sporeGate Overwatch, Wave 116

**Date**: 2026-06-18 11:30 EDT
**From**: sporeGate overwatch (Cursor on NUC)
**Scope**: Mesh enrollment, gate parity, NUCLEUS deployment, topology evolution, primal debt
**Wave**: 116

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 116 expanded the WireGuard mesh from 3 to 5 live nodes, deployed 11/13 NUCLEUS primals
to eastGate via user-level systemd (no sudo needed), resolved the Eero bridge failure with
a workaround and ordered the GL.iNet Flint 2 replacement, stopped the Omada SDN controller
after it broke port 8 connectivity, and shipped topology v5.0.0 with three-hub triangle
backbone model. cellMembrane tests were broken by a parallel IDE module extraction — fixed
here (547 passing, zero failures). The mesh is the healthiest it has ever been.

## WORKING — Verified Live (Jun 18 11:30 EDT)

| System | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **sporeGate 13/13 primals** | ACTIVE, systemd persisted | `membrane gate.status` reports 13/13 alive |
| **eastGate 11/13 primals** | ACTIVE, user-level systemd | 11 `membrane-nucleus@*.service` units running (no sudo) |
| **WireGuard 5-node mesh** | ALL LIVE | golgi(.1), sporeGate(.2), pepti(.4), eastGate(.5), flockGate(.6) — handshakes active |
| **nftables (plasma membrane)** | ACTIVE | 52 rules from `FirewallRuleset::for_composition()` |
| **sporeGate membrane binary** | FRESH (189d992) | `gate.preflight`, `firewall.generate`, `gate.status` all working |
| **cellMembrane tests** | **547 passing, 0 failures** | Fixed broken test compilation from parallel IDE module extraction |
| **LAN backbone** | ALL UP | eastGate, Omada, northGate, CRS310 — all reachable |
| **VPS mesh** | ALL UP | golgi (35ms), pepti (31ms), flockGate (72ms from sporeGate) |
| **eastGate SSH** | LIVE | `ssh eastgate@192.168.4.244` — sporeGate key authorized |
| **flockGate WG** | LIVE | `10.13.37.6`, systemd persisted, handshake active |
| **Sovereignty S1 (TLS)** | OK | membrane.primals.eco 200 OK (271ms) |
| **Sovereignty S2 (relay)** | OK | Federation reachable, RustDesk hbbs/hbbr active |
| **Sovereignty S3 (content)** | OK | Depot serving 10952KB |
| **Git cascade** | CLEAN (wateringHole) | Both remotes synced |
| **DHCP server** | ACTIVE | Pool 192.168.4.100-249 on eno1 |
| **Topology model** | v5.0.0 | Three-hub triangle, heterogeneous open hardware, 3 cytoplasm zones |
| **Disk** | 3% used (863G free) | No pressure |

## NOT WORKING — Blockers

| System | Status | Blocker | Impact |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **eastGate WG (sudo)** | INTERFACE UP but sudo-gated | `sudo -n wg` requires password | Cannot verify WG stats without operator sudo |
| **eastGate biomeos** | FAILED | `biomeos server` — unrecognized subcommand | cellMembrane team needs different CLI path for biomeos |
| **eastGate nestgate** | FAILED | Missing `NESTGATE_JWT_SECRET` env var | Security gate — needs proper JWT config |
| **flockGate SSH (via WG)** | TIMEOUT | `ssh 10.13.37.6` times out | SSH may not be listening on WG interface, or firewall blocks |
| **depot.integrity** | DEGRADED | `checksums.toml` not found | cellMembrane team needs to generate depot checksums |
| **mesh.reachability** | DEGRADED | songbird.sock permission denied | System-level primals vs user-level socket path mismatch |
| **sovereignty.s4_auth** | DEGRADED | beardog UDS unreachable | beardog runs (system-level) but gate.status probes user path |
| **cellMembrane VCS** | DIVERGED | forgejo/main 7 ahead, origin/main 3 ahead | cellMembrane team must reconcile |
| **ATT IP passthrough** | NOT CONFIGURED | Requires browser + Device Access Code | Double-NAT still active |
| **Eero** | WORKAROUND | Bridge mode crashed, reverted to NAT (10.0.7.x) | WiFi clients on separate NAT; retiring when Flint 2 arrives |
| **fieldGate** | OFFLINE | Dead CMOS | No software fix possible |

## PARTIALLY WORKING — Degraded

| System | Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Omada SX3008F** | STANDALONE L2 | Controller STOPPED after it broke port 8. Switch works unmanaged. All wired devices reachable. |
| **eastGate sudo** | INTERMITTENT | `pkexec` works interactively but `sudo -n` fails. WG and system-level ops need operator password. |
| **Omada port 8** | RECOVERED | After controller stopped + physical power cycle, port 8 restored. Wired connectivity nominal. |
| **WiFi (Eero)** | NAT WORKAROUND | Cat6 from CRS310 → Eero. Humans have WiFi but behind 10.0.7.x NAT. Not bridged. |

## Primal Debt Cleared This Session

### 1. cellMembrane Test Compilation Fixed

The parallel IDE team extracted modules from large files (good architectural work) but left
test references pointing at the old locations:

| File | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| `plasmid/fetch.rs` | `compute_blake3` not in scope after extraction to `checksum.rs` | Added `use super::checksum::compute_blake3;` to test module |
| `temporal/mod.rs` | `REGENERABLE_METADATA` moved to `sync_engine.rs` | Qualified as `sync_engine::REGENERABLE_METADATA` in tests |
| `temporal/sync_engine.rs` | const was private, tests in parent needed access | Changed to `pub(super) const` |
| `lib.rs` | Unused `use std::path::Path` in tests | Removed |

**Result**: 547 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 errors. Clean build.

### 2. Module Extraction Completed (parallel IDE work validated)

The parallel IDE correctly extracted:
- `plasmid/checksum.rs` — BLAKE3 compute/verify/fetch/persist/parse
- `plasmid/download.rs` — HTTP/SSH download transport, atomic write
- `temporal/sync_engine.rs` — converge/diverge/dirty-worktree/stash-pull logic
- `gate/interface.rs` — (new, untracked)

Our test fixes confirm the extraction is structurally correct.

## What Shipped This Wave (Wave 116)

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **5-node WireGuard mesh** | golgi, sporeGate, pepti, eastGate, flockGate — all live, handshakes active |
| **eastGate NUCLEUS 11/13** | User-level systemd — no sudo needed. songbird + 10 primals running. |
| **User-level systemd units** | `membrane-nucleus@.service` + `songbird-federation.service` — proven pattern for non-root deployment |
| **flockGate WAN enrollment** | WG live (32ms to golgi, 72ms to sporeGate), SSH done, systemd persisted |
| **Fresh membrane binary** | Built from HEAD (189d992) with gate.preflight + firewall.generate. Deployed to sporeGate + eastGate. |
| **Topology v5.0.0** | Three-hub triangle backbone, heterogeneous open hardware, 3 zones, Flint 2 planned |
| **Omada deep probe AAR** | Full API exploration — ports, VLANs, clients, STP, LLDP documented |
| **Eero decision** | Bridge mode proven unstable → ordered GL.iNet Flint 2 (OpenWrt) replacement |
| **Omada controller decision** | SDN controller broke port 8 → STOPPED. Switch runs standalone L2. |
| **WG IP conflict resolved** | eastGate moved from .3 to .5, marshgate keeps .3 (planned) |
| **cellMembrane test fix** | 547 tests restored to green after parallel IDE module extraction |
| **Hardware philosophy documented** | "Heterogeneous open" — no single vendor, no cloud management. Diversity forces robust primal abstraction. |

## Sub-Work Shared with cellMembrane Team

### Committed to HEAD (by sporeGate overwatch)

| What | File | Detail |
|------|------|--------|
| Test compilation fixes | `fetch.rs`, `mod.rs`, `sync_engine.rs`, `lib.rs` | Completed module extraction test wiring |
| `GateProfile` zone fields | `manifest.rs` | `zone`, `hub_port`, `link_speed_mbps` with serde defaults |
| K-Derm nftables generation | `firewall.rs` | Composition-deterministic `NftablesConfig` |
| Gate preflight scanner | `gate/preflight.rs` | Interface, WG, DNS, DHCP, nftables validation |

### Spec Handed Off (cellMembrane team to implement)

| Spec | File | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| **CYTOPLASM_ZONES_SPEC.md** | `wateringHole/handoffs/` | Zone types, topology.resolve, zone-aware preflight |

### Deployment Team Needs from cellMembrane Team

| Need | Priority | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Reconcile cellMembrane VCS diverge** | **P0** | forgejo 7 ahead, origin 3 ahead — true diverge blocks clean cascade |
| **Fix pepti SSH→forgejo** | P1 | Unblocks fresh binary builds from HEAD on build authority |
| **biomeos CLI path** | P1 | `biomeos server` is not a valid subcommand — different entrypoint needed |
| **nestgate JWT config** | P2 | Needs `NESTGATE_JWT_SECRET` environment for user-level deploy |
| **depot.integrity checksums** | P2 | `checksums.toml` missing from depot — gate.status reports DEGRADED |
| **Socket path alignment** | P2 | System-level primals on `/run/membrane/`, gate.status probes user path — mismatch |
| **topology.resolve command** | P3 | Zone-aware routing from CLI |

---

## Physical Operator Tasks

| Task | Steps | Priority | Time |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| **Flint 2 install** (ordered) | Unbox → AP mode → bridge to 192.168.4.x → same SSID → retire Eero | P1 | 30 min |
| **eastGate NOPASSWD sudo** | `visudo` add eastgate user | P2 | 5 min |
| **ATT IP passthrough** | Browser → 192.168.1.254 → Firewall → IP Passthrough → sporeGate MAC | P2 | 15 min |
| **Enable SSH on remaining gates** | RustDesk session → openssh-server → add pubkey | P2 | 10 min each |

---

## Experiment Priorities (Wave 117)

### Immediate (unblocked now)
1. **Push this AAR + test fixes** — cascade to both remotes
2. **flockGate NUCLEUS deploy** — WG live, SSH live, ready now
3. **sporeGate gate.status degraded probes** — investigate socket path alignment

### After Flint 2 Arrives
4. **WiFi sovereign swap** — OpenWrt AP, bridge mode, SSH/root access
5. **swiftGate relay push** — once WiFi restored
6. **Update topology** — retire Eero zone, add Flint 2 zone

### After cellMembrane Reconciliation
7. **Fresh depot with checksums** — builds on pepti from reconciled HEAD
8. **biomeos + nestgate on eastGate** — 13/13 target
9. **Socket path alignment** — unified /run/membrane or user-level equivalent

### After ATT Passthrough
10. **Direct WG endpoints** — sporeGate gets public IP, eliminate double-NAT
11. **Cellular failover test** — Mint Mobile hotspot as WAN metric 500

## Metrics

| Metric | Wave 115 | Wave 116 | Delta |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Primals alive (sporeGate) | 13/13 | 13/13 | — |
| Primals alive (eastGate) | 0/13 | 11/13 | **+11** |
| WireGuard mesh nodes | 3 | 5 | **+2** |
| Gates fully enrolled | 1 | 1 | — (eastGate at 11/13, not 13/13) |
| Gates on sovereign relay | 5 | 5 | — |
| cellMembrane tests | 471 (broken) | 547 (passing) | **+76, fixed** |
| VCS parity | 17/17 | 16/17 (cellMembrane diverge) | -1 |
| LAN devices reachable | 15+ | 15+ | — |
| Cytoplasm zones | 3 | 3 (+garage planned) | — |
| Topology version | 4.0.0 | 5.0.0 | +1 major |
| Omada controller | ACTIVE | **STOPPED** | stopped (broke port 8) |
| Eero status | "workaround" | RETIRING (Flint 2 ordered) | decision made |
| Hardware philosophy | implicit | **documented** | "heterogeneous open" |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| cellMembrane diverge grows | HIGH | Cascade blocks | P0: reconcile this wave |
| Flint 2 shipping delay | LOW | WiFi stays on Eero NAT workaround | Cat6 direct from CRS310 is stable |
| ATT outage (no passthrough) | LOW | Double-NAT but functional | Cellular failover planned |
| Omada config corruption (if controller restarts) | MEDIUM | Port 8 breaks again | Controller STOPPED + disabled from boot |
| eastGate sudo access revoked | LOW | Can't upgrade to 13/13 | User-level systemd handles 11/13 without sudo |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **User-level systemd is the deploy pattern**: Deploying NUCLEUS without sudo via `membrane-nucleus@.service` user units worked on first try (after path fix). This should be the standard for all consumer gates.

2. **Cloud management planes are hostile**: Omada SDN controller broke working L2 by pushing an unwanted config. Standalone L2 is the correct posture for switches we don't fully control via sovereign software.

3. **Eero is not bridgeable in multi-hop L2**: Bridge mode failed because DHCP requests couldn't traverse Eero → TL-SG605S → Omada → CRS310 → sporeGate. Consumer mesh WiFi with proprietary firmware is incompatible with sovereign networking.

4. **Heterogeneous hardware forces better software**: MikroTik (RouterOS) + TP-Link (standalone L2) + GL.iNet (OpenWrt) + ATT (proprietary WAN) — no single vendor failure mode. The membrane primal must abstract all of them.

5. **Module extraction needs test wiring**: The parallel IDE's architectural improvement (extracting checksum.rs, download.rs, sync_engine.rs) was correct but left test imports broken. Always run `cargo test` after module extraction.

6. **WireGuard IP assignment needs a registry**: The .3 conflict (eastGate vs marshgate) happened because assignments were scattered. `WIREGUARD_MESH.toml` is now the canonical source.
