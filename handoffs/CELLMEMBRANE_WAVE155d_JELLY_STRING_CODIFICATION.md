# cellMembrane Wave 155d — J1+J2 Jelly String Codification

**Date**: 2026-07-28 | **Trigger**: Tower Atomic hardening — J1 harvest + J2 push codification
**Commit**: (pending push) | **Gate**: sporeGate (eastGate overwatch)

## What Changed

### J1: `plasmid.harvest` — Already Rust, Enhanced (P0)

**Finding**: J1 "harvest is shell loops" was already resolved — orchestration
is pure Rust `for` loops. External tool calls (`cargo`, `strip`, `git`) are
inherent toolchain dependencies, not replaceable shell loops.

**Enhancement**: Added `--push` flag to `plasmid.harvest`. When set, harvest
automatically pushes built binaries to VPS depot after successful build,
combining the harvest→push cycle into a single command:

```
membrane plasmid.harvest --all --local --push
```

Implementation: `append_push_outcome()` calls `depot_sync_push_standalone()`
after `finalize_depot()`. Push is skipped on dry-run or when nothing was built.

### J2: `plasmid.push` — First-Class Command + Depot Sync Refactor (P1)

**New command**: `plasmid.push` dispatched directly (was hidden behind
`plasmid.depot_sync --push`).

**Refactored default `depot_sync`**: The monolithic 30-line embedded bash
`for` loop sent as a single SSH command has been replaced with Rust-orchestrated
per-primal SSH commands:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 30-line bash `for p in $list` loop | Rust `for primal in &primals` loop |
| Single SSH command, all-or-nothing | Per-primal `sync_single_remote()` |
| Inline bash string concatenation | `RemoteSyncResult` enum (Synced/Current/Missing/Failed) |
| Output parsed from `synced=N current=N ...` | Direct counter tracking |

The per-primal approach uses 2 SSH commands per primal (hash+diff, copy+verify)
vs 1 monolithic command. Trade-off: marginally more SSH connections, but each
operation is individually observable, error-recoverable, and testable.

### Extract + Modularity

`harvest()` was approaching the 100-line clippy limit after the push addition:
- Extracted `finalize_depot()` — post-build metadata/signing/publish phase
- Extracted `append_push_outcome()` — push result merging
- `#[allow(clippy::struct_excessive_bools)]` on `HarvestArgs` (4 bool flags: `force`, `dry_run`, `local`, `push`)

## Jelly String Status After This Wave

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| J1 | Harvest is shell loops | **CLOSED** | Was already Rust. Added `--push`. |
| J2 | Depot push is rsync | **CLOSED** | `plasmid.push` + Rust depot_sync refactor. |
| J3 | Service restart manual | **CLOSED** (songBird) | `deploy.hot_swap` |
| J4 | Caddy config manual | **CLOSED** (songBird) | route self-config |
| J5 | WG peer reg manual | **HARDENED** (songBird) | WG peer management |
| J6 | systemd overrides manual | OPEN | Next: `InitSystem` config generation |
| J7 | Legacy service detection | OPEN (low priority) | |

---

## For eastGate Overwatch

- **J1+J2 CLOSED** — `plasmid.harvest --all --local --push` is now a single
  command for the full harvest→push cycle. No more manual rsync to golgiBody.
- **J6 (systemd overrides manual)** is the next cellMembrane jelly string.
  Cross-platform groundwork is already laid (`InitSystem::detect()` from
  Wave 155b). J6 would generate service configs for each init system.
- **Tower Atomic hardening** posture maintained per Wave 155d sequencing.
