# cellMembrane Team Blurb — Wave 127 Topology Update

**Date**: Jun 27, 2026 07:30 EDT | **Wave**: 127 | **From**: sporeGate topology session
**Status**: Physical topology stabilized. Infrastructure layer independent of compute. Ready for k-derm transport evolution.

## What Changed (Wave 127)

The physical network underwent a full topology cutover. **sporeGate is no longer the edge router.** The plasma membrane role has moved to dedicated infrastructure hardware.

### New Architecture

### Key Changes for cellMembrane

| Before (Wave 126) | After (Wave 127) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| sporeGate = gateway at .1 | sporeGate = compute at .3 |
| Flint = bridge (WiFi only) | Flint = edge router (full stack) |
| Unplug sporeGate = network dead | Unplug sporeGate = network survives |
| dnsmasq on sporeGate | dnsmasq on Flint (.1) |
| NAT/firewall on sporeGate | NAT/firewall on Flint |
| ATT passthrough → sporeGate | ATT passthrough → Flint WAN MAC |

## What This Means for Transport Layers

The physical substrate is now **stable and independent of compute**. This enables full k-derm transport iteration without risking network outages.

### LAN Transport (inner membrane)

- Gateway is now `192.168.4.1` (Flint), not sporeGate
- All gates still get `192.168.4.x/22` via DHCP from Flint
- sporeGate at `.3` is just another LAN peer — same L2 domain
- CRS310 backbone unchanged (2.5G/10G switching)
- cellMembrane LAN discovery/relay should target `.3` for sporeGate services
- DNS: `.primals.local` domains resolved by Flint dnsmasq

### WAN Transport (outer membrane)

- Public IP: `162.226.225.148` on Flint WAN
- WireGuard port: `51821/udp` forwarded from Flint → sporeGate:51821
- SSH: `22/tcp` forwarded → sporeGate:22
- HTTPS: `443/tcp` forwarded → sporeGate:443 (Caddy)
- All inbound WAN traffic still terminates at sporeGate — transparent to remote peers
- WireGuard mesh intact (golgi handshake active, 10.13.37.0/24 overlay)
- Remote gates (flockGate, etc.) see no change — same public IP, same ports

### VPS Transport (golgi relay)

- No change. WireGuard tunnel from sporeGate (.2) → golgi (.1) still active
- golgi endpoint: `157.230.3.183:51820`
- Auto-cascade relay continues (15min interval)
- BTSP/relay.forward paths unchanged

## What cellMembrane Should Evolve

Now that the infrastructure layer is resilient, the k-derm transport layers can iterate freely:

1. **LAN discovery**: Update any hardcoded `.1` references to use DNS (`sporegate.primals.local`) or the WireGuard overlay IP (`10.13.37.2`). The gateway is no longer sporeGate.

2. **Failover awareness**: cellMembrane can now model the two-layer architecture — if a compute node disappears, transport should gracefully degrade (retry, reroute via golgi relay) rather than assuming network death.

3. **Port-forward transparency**: From cellMembrane's perspective, inbound connections still arrive at sporeGate's interfaces. The Flint DNAT is invisible to application-layer code.

4. **DNS-based service discovery**: Flint's dnsmasq serves `.primals.local` — cellMembrane can register service names here for LAN peer discovery without hardcoding IPs.

5. **Hot-plug compute model**: sporeGate can now travel (personal NUC, data science hotspot, hazardous network anchor). cellMembrane transport should handle reconnection gracefully when a gate re-appears on the mesh after absence.

## Connectivity to sporeGate (for development)

```bash
# SSH (from LAN)
ssh sporegate@192.168.4.3

# SSH (from WAN / remote gate)
ssh sporegate@162.226.225.148

# SSH (via WireGuard overlay)
ssh sporegate@10.13.37.2

# Forgejo
https://git.primals.eco  (→ 443 → sporeGate Caddy)
ssh://git.primals.eco:2222  (→ 2222 → Forgejo)
```

## Verified State

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Internet (8.8.8.8) | 13ms, 0% loss |
| WireGuard mesh | Handshake active |
| DNS blocking (ads) | juicyads.com → NXDOMAIN |
| DNS allow (adult) | redgifs.com → resolves |
| Pull test | sporeGate unplugged + rebooted, network survived |
| Flint uptime | 1d 21h (never went down during cutover) |
