# primalSpring Phase 45b — BTSP Escalation & Entropy Hierarchy Handoff

**Date**: April 2026
**From**: primalSpring v0.9.17 (Phase 45b)
**For**: Primal teams (BearDog, Songbird, rhizoCrypt, sweetGrass, loamSpine, biomeOS) + all spring teams
**License**: AGPL-3.0-or-later

---

## What Happened

primalSpring implemented **incremental BTSP escalation** with machine-level
entropy (mito tier) for portable validation. The guidestone binary now reports
**161/166 checks passing** against a live 12-primal NUCLEUS. The 5 FAILs are
legitimate upstream gaps — primals that should enforce BTSP but don't yet
implement the server-side handshake protocol.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Entropy Hierarchy (Mito Tier)

Machine-level entropy for portable validation:
- `MitoSeed`: deterministic, clonable from `FAMILY_SEED` or `.family.seed`
- Proves group membership for BTSP Phase 1 handshake key derivation
- Published seed fingerprints (BLAKE3) in `plasmidBin/manifest.toml`
- Nuclear tier (future): human entropy mixed, sovereign identity

### 2. Incremental BTSP Escalation

Security builds incrementally from cleartext:

| Phase | State | What Changes |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Bootstrap | Cleartext | biomeOS starts `BIOMEOS_BTSP_ENFORCE=0` |
| Tower BTSP | Encrypted | BearDog + Songbird authenticate |
| Node/Nest | Delegated | ToadStool, barraCuda, coralReef, NestGate trust Tower |
| Provenance | Encrypted | rhizoCrypt, sweetGrass, loamSpine authenticate |
| Full NUCLEUS | Encrypted | All capabilities authenticated or delegated |

### 3. Guidestone Layer 1.5

Reports per-atomic security posture:
- Tower: BTSP expected (currently FAIL — upstream gap)
- Node: tower_delegated (PASS — cleartext OK)
- Nest: tower_delegated (PASS — cleartext OK)
- Provenance: BTSP expected (currently FAIL — upstream gap)
- biomeOS substrate: Neural API liveness + graph executor validated

### 4. Seed Provenance (Layer 0.5)

Public BLAKE3 fingerprints verify binary authenticity before any IPC.
Every primal in `plasmidBin/manifest.toml` has a `seed_fingerprint` entry.
Layer 0.5 runs before discovery — untampered binaries safe for use.

## What Primal Teams Need to Do

### BearDog (Tower — security)

**Gap**: `ClientHello` JSON treated as invalid JSON-RPC → Parse error → connection close.

**Fix**: On the primary UDS socket, detect first-byte `{` with `"type":"ClientHello"` and
branch to the BTSP handshake flow before JSON-RPC dispatch. BearDog already has `btsp_client.rs`
client-side code — the server needs the mirror: accept `ClientHello`, respond `ServerHello`,
validate `ChallengeResponse`, complete with `HandshakeComplete`. HMAC-SHA256 with
`FAMILY_SEED` key derivation. See `primalSpring/ecoPrimal/src/btsp/` for reference.

### Songbird (Tower — discovery)

**Gap**: HTTP-framed UDS with no BTSP listener.

**Fix**: Songbird's UDS socket speaks HTTP. Either add a BTSP upgrade mechanism
(WebSocket-style handshake before HTTP) or expose a separate BTSP-authenticated socket
for secure discovery. The simpler path: add a `/btsp` HTTP endpoint that upgrades
the connection to the encrypted channel post-handshake.

### rhizoCrypt (Provenance — DAG)

**Gap**: No BTSP server on DAG socket.

**Fix**: Same first-byte detect pattern as BearDog. rhizoCrypt already has
`PeekedStream`-style auto-detect — extend it to recognize BTSP `ClientHello`.

### sweetGrass (Provenance — commit)

**Gap**: No BTSP server on commit socket.

**Fix**: sweetGrass has `PeekedStream` first-byte auto-detect on UDS + TCP.
Extend to recognize BTSP `ClientHello` alongside JSON-RPC `{`.

### loamSpine (Provenance — provenance)

**Gap**: No BTSP server on provenance socket.

**Fix**: Same pattern. loamSpine already normalizes empty params — add BTSP
handshake detection before JSON-RPC dispatch.

### biomeOS (Substrate)

**Gap**: Starts in cleartext mode (`BIOMEOS_BTSP_ENFORCE=0`). Cannot participate
in encrypted NUCLEUS without its own Tower Atomic capability.

**Evolution path**: biomeOS routes through Tower Atomic for all transport.
Short-term: cleartext bootstrap is correct (Tower isn't alive when biomeOS starts).
Long-term: biomeOS either implements BTSP client/server directly or delegates
all IPC transport to Songbird mesh relay + BearDog BTSP.

## What Spring Teams Need to Know

### Encrypted by Default (When Upstream Is Ready)

Once the 5 primal teams implement BTSP server handshake, the NUCLEUS will be
encrypted by default with zero changes needed in spring code. The escalation
is transparent — `upgrade_btsp_clients()` handles it automatically.

### Seed Fingerprints for Your GuideStone

If you're building a domain guideStone, you can use Layer 0.5 as-is:
```rust
use primalspring::composition::CompositionContext;
// CompositionContext::from_running() already verifies seed fingerprints
```

### Your BTSP Reporting

Your guidestone inherits Layer 1.5 BTSP reporting through `CompositionContext`.
The `btsp_state()` map tells you which capabilities are authenticated:
```rust
for (cap, authenticated) in ctx.btsp_state() {
    if *authenticated {
        // BTSP-encrypted channel
    } else {
        // cleartext or tower-delegated
    }
}
```

### The Three-Tier Composition Pattern Still Applies

- **Tier 1 (LOCAL)**: Your Rust math. Always green. No IPC needed.
- **Tier 2 (IPC-WIRED)**: Call primals by capability. `check_skip()` when absent.
- **Tier 3 (FULL NUCLEUS)**: Deploy from plasmidBin, run guideStone externally.
  BTSP escalation is automatic when `FAMILY_SEED` is set.
