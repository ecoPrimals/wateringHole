# ironGate Hardware Team AAR — Aug 2, 2026 (Session 2)

**Date**: 2026-08-02 09:20 EDT
**Gate**: ironGate (10.13.37.7)
**Team**: Hardware + Deployment
**Cascade**: Silicon Deism + Publication Phase (Aug 2 AM)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NUCLEUS confirmed stable after overnight. Live primal composition validated
against running NUCLEUS — esotericWebb exp006 connects to 4/9 primals directly,
all 9 reachable via biomeOS Neural API. Game session runs ("The Weaver's Parlor"),
actions execute, state advances. One stale test assertion fixed (exp002).
All experiments pass. 472 tests, 0 clippy warnings.

## VALIDATION RESULTS

### NUCLEUS Health (morning check)

```
biomeOS doctor: 21/21 sockets HEALTHY
GPU: RTX 5070 idle (3% util, 56°C, 35W)
RAM: 82/94 GB available
Disk: 3.2/3.6 TB available
```

### esotericWebb Live Composition (exp006)

```
Discovery: 4/9 primals connected directly (squirrel, beardog, rhizocrypt, loamspine)
           All 9 reachable via biomeOS Neural API routing
Session:   "The Weaver's Parlor" loaded (12 available actions)
Actions:   examine → outcome text + scene context (narration context populated)
           exit(parlor) → node changed, state updated
State:     2 turns, 2 history entries, knowledge gained: ["shop_layout"]
Enrichment: SKIP (primals respond but don't fire ai.narrate/scene.push for this content)
Result:    21 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 SKIP → OK
```

### All Experiments

| Experiment | Result |
|------------|--------|
| exp001 (narrative reachability) | 12 pass, 0 fail |
| exp002 (composition wiring) | 12 pass, 0 fail (fixed stale assertion) |
| exp004 (provenance trio TCP) | 0 pass, 1 skip (rhizocrypt binary not in local plasmidBin) |
| exp005 (autoplay coverage) | not run (requires content pack) |
| exp006 (live composition) | 21 pass, 0 fail, 1 skip |

### Code Quality

| Garden | Tests | Clippy | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| esotericWebb | 472 pass | 0 warnings | pedantic+nursery clean |
| projectFOUNDATION | 199 pass | 0 warnings | clean |
| lithoSpore | 242 pass | 78 warnings (pre-existing in ltee-cli) | not our change |

## BUG FIX SHIPPED

**exp002 stale assertion**: `render_scene` in standalone mode correctly returns
`Err(PrimalNotFound)` (rendering requires a primal — no graceful degradation possible).
The experiment had an outdated assertion expecting `Ok(())`. Fixed to match the
unit test in `bridge/mod.rs` and the actual `render_scene` contract.

- File: `experiments/exp002_composition_wiring/src/main.rs`
- Change: `is_ok()` → `is_err()` with updated description

## OBSERVATIONS FOR OVERWATCH

1. **ironGate is NUCLEUS-live, not Tower Atomic** — cascade still lists "Tower Atomic" in
   the gate fleet table. Recommend update.

2. **Live composition works** — esotericWebb can run game sessions against the real NUCLEUS
   substrate. 4 primals respond directly via UDS, remainder routed through Neural API.

3. **Enrichment path not firing** — the "examine" action produces text but AI narration
   and scene push don't fire. This is expected: squirrel responds to health checks but
   `ai.query` with game prompts may need prompt formatting that matches squirrel's
   expected schema. Code team item, not hardware blocker.

4. **exp004 (provenance trio)** skips because it looks for rhizocrypt binary in a local
   `plasmidBin/` directory. The primal IS running (socket healthy), but the experiment
   uses a different discovery path. Low priority.

5. **lithoSpore warnings** — 78 clippy warnings in `ltee-cli` crate (pre-existing debt).
   Not introduced by this session. Code team item.

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| NUCLEUS 13/13 | HEALTHY (21/21 sockets) |
| GPU | RTX 5070 available, CUDA 12.8 |
| Mesh | golgi 38ms, sporeGate 77ms, eastGate 78ms |
| Forgejo | SSH push verified |
| Gardens | esotericWebb + projectFOUNDATION + lithoSpore: build + test + lint clean |

## WHAT'S NEXT (hardware team)

- Monitor socket stability under sustained exp006 runs
- Support code team when they wire enrichment path (petalTongue scene push)
- Await biomeGate results on G32 silicon deism (multi-GPU dispatch)
- Planned service interruption today (Aug 2) — ATT gateway move. May lose connectivity.
