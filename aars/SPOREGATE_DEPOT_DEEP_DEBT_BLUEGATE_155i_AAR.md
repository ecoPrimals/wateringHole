# sporeGate Depot Deep Debt Refresh + blueGate Enrollment — Wave 155i AAR

**Date**: 2026-07-29 (afternoon session)
**Gate**: sporeGate (build authority, peptidoglycan anchor H1)
**Scope**: Deep-debt depot rebuild (8 primals), blueGate WG+SSH enrollment, P1 resolution

---

## Summary

Composition broker shipped (biomeOS v4.45), ZERO P0s remaining. This session
rebuilt all 19 depot binaries from Wave 155i deep-debt commits (8 primals evolved),
resolving 3 sporeGate-owned P1s: songBird Windows fix (blocks blueGate G1),
biomeOS v4.45 depot binary (blocks E2E signal graphs), sweetGrass v0.8.0 (blocks
westGate G3 validation). Enrolled blueGate — WG peer + Forgejo SSH key registered,
tunnel LIVE. Peptidoglycan anchor H2 connected.

## What We Did

### 1. songBird Windows P0 Fix — Depot Rebuild (P1 RESOLVED)

**Problem**: songBird shipped Windows platform gate TCP fallback (`8c0adc8d`) but
the depot binary was stale (`c4c5d2d`). blueGate Tower 2/3 blocked on songBird
depot pull.

**Fix**: Pulled songBird to `8c0adc8d`, harvested with `--local --force`.

**Result**: songBird 18,653KB in depot. blueGate can now pull and complete Tower 3/3.

### 2. biomeOS v4.45 Composition Broker — Depot Rebuild (P1 RESOLVED)

**Problem**: biomeOS shipped composition broker (riboCipher framing + BTSP session
propagation, `8cee1adb`) but depot had v4.41 (`4667f584`). E2E signal graph
validation blocked.

**Fix**: Pulled biomeOS to `8cee1adb`, harvested. 15,935KB binary.

**Result**: Composition broker available in depot for all gates. E2E `nest.ingest_dataset`
and `nest.store` signal graphs unblocked.

### 3. sweetGrass v0.8.0 G3 E2E — Depot Rebuild (P1 RESOLVED)

**Problem**: sweetGrass shipped G3 E2E wiring with 11 ledger tests (`ab887e8`) but
depot had v0.7.64. westGate Provenance Trio live validation blocked.

**Fix**: Pulled sweetGrass to `ab887e8`, harvested. 8,336KB binary.

**Result**: G3 E2E binary in depot. Provenance Trio 6/7 → can validate on westGate.

### 4. Deep Debt Primal Fleet Rebuild (5 additional primals)

All primals rebuilt from Wave 155i deep-debt commits:

| Primal | Commit | Size (musl KB) | Key Evolution |
|--------|--------|---------------:|---------------|
| songBird | `8c0adc8d` | 18,653 | Windows P0 fix + deep debt |
| biomeOS | `8cee1adb` | 15,935 | Composition broker v4.45 |
| nestGate | `6b6d4849` | 8,660 | CAS on ZFS, 13K+ tests |
| toadStool | `b9ded428` | 13,147 | S346 security fail-closed |
| barraCuda | `34603689` | 11,410 | RTX 3090 profiled, deprecation sweep |
| coralReef | `c6ab001f` | 9,069 | 463 .expect() purged, PTX modernized |
| skunkBat | `b0df971c` | 3,005 | tokio-macros update |
| sweetGrass | `ab887e83` | 8,336 | G3 E2E validated, 1,636 tests |
| cellMembrane | `54d0865` | 16,027 | Sandbox fail-closed, registry-driven tower |

glibc targets also rebuilt for compute trio:

| Primal | gnu (KB) | Commit |
|--------|----------|--------|
| barraCuda | 11,530 | `34603689` |
| coralReef | 8,964 | `c6ab001f` |
| toadStool | 12,978 | `b9ded428` |

### 5. blueGate Enrollment — Peptidoglycan Anchor H2

**Problem**: blueGate needed WireGuard mesh access and Forgejo write access to
begin Tower Atomic deployment and sub-builder role.

**Fix**:
- Registered WG peer: `sJKbtjyHFXFPnHnzePuK9jX/6QBHyWKC2KimRJb6RlE=` → `10.13.37.12/32`
  on golgiBody (peer #9, persisted to `wg0.conf`)
- Registered SSH key in Forgejo: key ID 14, title `blueGate@primals.eco`,
  fingerprint `SHA256:RWaM9xBul9r+mTrxTPvRN97gOhk6Pu3/nlLjPdAW4Bw`

**Result**: WG tunnel LIVE — handshake active from `162.226.225.148`. blueGate
can clone repos from `git.primals.eco` and pull depot binaries. 9-gate mesh.

## P1 Rollup Resolution

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | songBird Windows fix depot rebuild | **RESOLVED** — `8c0adc8d` in depot |
| 2 | sweetGrass depot binary lag (v0.7.64 vs v0.8.0) | **RESOLVED** — `ab887e8` in depot |
| 3 | biomeOS depot binary lag (v4.45 not in depot) | **RESOLVED** — `8cee1adb` in depot |
| 4 | bearDog `crypto.sign_ed25519` stub | Code team (bearDog) |
| 5 | mesh.reachability + rootpulse.ledger | Code team (songBird + cellMembrane) |
| 6 | songBird riboCipher probe noise | Code team (songBird) |
| 7 | hotSpring Forgejo pack corruption | eastGate admin |

All sporeGate-owned P1s resolved. ZERO P0s ecosystem-wide.

## Depot Manifest (Post Deep Debt Refresh)

| Target | Binaries | Total Size |
|--------|----------|------------|
| x86_64-unknown-linux-musl | 16 | ~171MB |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | 3 (barraCuda, coralReef, toadStool) | ~34MB |

BLAKE3 checksums: 19/19 verified, 0 mismatches. Gate health: 9/11 OK.

## blueGate Next Steps (their lane)

1. Pull depot binaries (songBird now available)
2. Complete Tower 3/3 (songBird service start)
3. Set `MEMBRANE_BUILD_AUTHORITY=1` for sub-builder role
4. Begin Nest Atomic deployment (biomeOS composition broker in depot)
5. Begin Node Atomic deployment
