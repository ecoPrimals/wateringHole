**Date**: Aug 1, 2026 09:00 EDT
**Gate**: westGate
**Wave**: post-155n (springs+gardens phase entry)
**Author**: westGate overwatch (agent-assisted)
**biomeOS**: v4.56.0 (G22 COMPLETE, 15h stable uptime)

## TL;DR

Wave 155 closed. Primals are the foundation. westGate enters the springs+gardens phase
as a data/CAS workhorse with legitimate compute capability. 13/13 NUCLEUS stable overnight
(15h, zero socket drift). Cascade absorbed: J12 sub-builder E2E PROVEN, G22 validated on
sporeGate, GNU depot 5->15 COMPLETE (46 total). Three new repos cloned for springs phase
(hotSpring, tideGlass, footPrint). Full data requirements survey completed across all
springs. westGate's 50.7 TB ZFS pool can hold the foundational science datasets that make
the ecosystem's springs tractable — AlphaFold, GenBank, LINCS, ChEMBL, PDB — content-addressed
and provenance-signed from ingestion.

## westGate Hardware — A Powerhouse, Not Just Storage

Every gate in the mesh is a powerhouse. westGate's primary niche is data/CAS, but its
hardware can evolve into any role. The mesh is sub-niches enmeshed together — each gate
brings its own capabilities, each gate's role changes as the ecosystem demands.

| Component | Spec | Capability |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, 8C/16T, 4.67 GHz boost | 16 parallel data pipeline workers |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 3070 8GB, CUDA 13.0, 5888 cores | WGSL/CUDA compute, ML inference, shader rendering |
| **RAM** | 64 GB DDR4 (51 GB available) | Large working sets, in-memory CAS index |
| **NVMe** | Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB (root, 1.6 TB free) | Hot tier — active CAS, model weights, working data |
| **HDD Pool** | 5×14TB raidz1 = **50.7 TB usable** | Cold tier — bulk science datasets, CAS archive |
| **SSD Cache** | 2TB SATA SSD (ZFS L2ARC) | Warm tier — frequently accessed CAS objects |
| **Network** | **10 Gbps** Ethernet | Saturate for bulk data ingestion and cross-gate federation |

**westGate can run hotSpring physics, neuralSpring ML training, and tideGlass screening —
not just store data for them.** The RTX 3070 is strandGate's 3090's smaller sibling, but
it runs the same WGSL shaders, the same barraCuda tensor ops, the same coralReef pipelines.
The gate's role in the mesh will evolve as workloads demand.

## Springs Data Requirements — Making the Intractable Tractable

The core insight: these scientific datasets are individually manageable but collectively
intractable for any single research lab without dedicated infrastructure. A 50.7 TB
content-addressed, provenance-signed pool changes the equation. Every object gets BLAKE3
integrity, DAG history, Ed25519 signatures, and attribution braids. The data becomes a
reusable sovereign asset, not a throwaway download.

### Per-Spring Working Sets

| Spring/Garden | Primary Data | Estimated Size | westGate Role |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **tideGlass** | LINCS L1000, ChEMBL, PubChem, ZINC, NF Portal | 120–200 GB | **CAS ingest + serve** — drug repurposing datasets through nestGate |
| **hotSpring** | Dense Plasma Properties DB + generated simulation output | 50–200 GB | **CAS archive** — physics simulation results with full provenance |
| **wetSpring** | NCBI SRA accessions (16S, metagenomics), ref DBs | 30–255 GB | **CAS ingest** — sequence data through pseudoSpore pipeline |
| **neuralSpring** | LINCS subsets, model checkpoints | 15–60 GB | **CAS store** — model weights as provenance-signed artifacts |
| **groundSpring** | Satellite imagery, sensor calibration data | 6–21 GB | **CAS ingest** — GIS/remote sensing data |
| **healthSpring** | ChEMBL JAK, ADDRC HTS, NF compound libraries | ~2 GB | **CAS store** — small but high-value provenance targets |
| **footPrint** | GIS tile cache, project data | ~5 GB | **Serve** — protist draws from CAS-backed map tiles |
| **esotericWebb** | Game assets, scene data | ~2 GB | **Federation** — assets served from ironGate, cached locally |

**Spring working set total: ~230–745 GB** (fits entirely on NVMe hot tier)

### Bulk Science — The Real Prize

These are the datasets that make westGate's 50.7 TB pool essential. Without dedicated
storage, labs download subsets, lose them, re-download, never have the full picture.
We pull the whole thing, content-address it, and it becomes a permanent, verifiable,
federable asset.

| Dataset | Size (compressed) | Size (expanded) | Springs Served | Priority |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **AlphaFold DB v4** | ~23 TB | ~23 TB | tideGlass, healthSpring, wetSpring | **FIRST** |
| **PDB** (experimental structures) | ~65 GB | ~200 GB | tideGlass, hotSpring, healthSpring | **FIRST** |
| **GenBank** (nt + nr) | ~3.5 TB | ~3.5 TB | wetSpring, tideGlass | SECOND |
| **RefSeq** | ~2 TB | ~2 TB | wetSpring, tideGlass | SECOND |
| **LINCS L1000** (full Level 5) | ~15 GB | ~100 GB | tideGlass, neuralSpring | **FIRST** |
| **ChEMBL** (full) | ~4 GB | ~4 GB | tideGlass, healthSpring | **FIRST** |
| **PubChem** (full SDF) | ~80 GB | ~300 GB | tideGlass, healthSpring | SECOND |
| **ZINC** (screening tranches) | ~10 GB | ~10 GB | tideGlass | **FIRST** |
| **UniProt** (reference proteomes) | ~500 GB | ~500 GB | tideGlass, wetSpring | SECOND |
| **TCGA** (cancer genomics) | ~2.5 TB | ~2.5 TB | healthSpring, tideGlass | THIRD |
| **GTEx** (tissue expression) | ~500 GB | ~500 GB | tideGlass, neuralSpring | THIRD |
| **OpenTargets** | ~50 GB | ~50 GB | tideGlass, healthSpring | SECOND |
| **ENCODE** | ~1 TB | ~1 TB | neuralSpring | THIRD |

**Phase 1 (immediate)**: AlphaFold + PDB + LINCS + ChEMBL + ZINC = **~24 TB**
Fits on raidz1 with 26 TB headroom. Unblocks tideGlass entirely and feeds
healthSpring + neuralSpring.

**Phase 2**: GenBank + RefSeq + UniProt + PubChem + OpenTargets = **~6.5 TB**
Cumulative: ~30.5 TB (20 TB headroom). Unblocks wetSpring full pipeline.

**Phase 3**: TCGA + GTEx + ENCODE = **~4 TB**
Cumulative: ~34.5 TB (16 TB headroom). Deep genomics cross-referencing.

**Total addressable science at 50.7 TB**: The first three phases consume ~35 TB,
leaving 15 TB for generated data (hotSpring simulations, neuralSpring model
checkpoints, cross-gate federation cache). With ZFS lz4 compression at 1.56×
observed ratio, effective capacity is higher for compressible formats.

## Ingestion Pipeline Architecture

Every dataset enters through the same pipeline — the one Provenance 7/7 validated
8 consecutive times:

```
Source (NCBI/EBI/RCSB/etc.)
  → wget/aria2c bulk download (10 Gbps saturated)
  → pseudoSpore envelope (scope.toml + validation.json)
  → nestGate content.put (BLAKE3 CAS, ZFS cold tier)
  → rhizoCrypt DAG event (ingestion lineage)
  → loamSpine spine.create (Merkle certificate)
  → bearDog crypto.sign_ed25519 (signature)
  → sweetGrass braid.create (attribution: source, license, date, provenance)
```

Every object in the pool carries its full provenance chain. When strandGate needs
an AlphaFold structure for a hotSpring computation, it calls `content.replicate.pull`
via songBird federation — and gets the object with its provenance intact. When
tideGlass screens LINCS profiles, the data is already in CAS with BLAKE3 integrity
verified on every read.

## westGate's Evolving Niche

westGate starts as the data/CAS workhorse, but the niche will evolve:

**Now**: Bulk science data ingestion and CAS storage. Pull whole datasets that are
otherwise intractable for individual labs. Content-address everything. Sign everything.

**Soon**: Data preprocessing and feature extraction. The RTX 3070 runs barraCuda tensor
ops for LINCS dimensionality reduction, ChEMBL featurization, AlphaFold structure
embedding. CPU runs Rust-native preprocessing (BLAST indexing, FASTA parsing, GCTx
streaming). NVMe hot tier caches active working sets.

**Later**: Federation hub. As more gates come online (steamGate, darwinGate, southGate),
westGate becomes the canonical data source — `content.replicate.pull` serves CAS objects
to the mesh. The 10 Gbps NIC matters here. Other gates compute; westGate stores the
ground truth.

**Eventually**: The role is dynamic. biomeOS composition broker + songBird mesh visibility
mean workloads can shift. If strandGate is saturated with hotSpring GPU work, westGate's
RTX 3070 picks up overflow. If ironGate needs training data for esotericWebb, westGate
serves it. Each gate is a powerhouse; the mesh is elastic.

## Observations

1. **Every gate is a powerhouse in its own right.** westGate has GPU, strandGate has
   bigger GPU, southGate has newest CPU + most RAM + fastest NVMe. The mesh isn't
   "server + clients" — it's peers with specializations. Each gate's niche is its
   starting point, not its ceiling.

2. **50.7 TB changes the game for science data.** Labs typically work with subsets because
   they can't store whole databases. We can pull AlphaFold (23 TB) + GenBank (3.5 TB) +
   all the reference databases and still have 20+ TB free. Every object provenance-signed
   from ingestion. This is the intractable made tractable.

3. **The ingestion pipeline is proven.** 8 consecutive Provenance 7/7 passes validate
   that every object entering the pool gets full provenance. The pipeline works. We just
   need to point it at real datasets.

4. **tideGlass is the critical path.** It's the gen5 artifact — the first real spring
   workload through NUCLEUS. It needs LINCS + ChEMBL + PubChem + ZINC, all of which
   are small enough (120-200 GB) to ingest in minutes on 10G. AlphaFold is the big one
   that takes days.

5. **Springs working sets fit on NVMe.** The ~230-745 GB combined working set across all
   springs fits entirely on the 1.6 TB free NVMe. ZFS L2ARC (2 TB SATA SSD) handles
   warm-tier CAS caching. The 5-tier storage architecture (CPU cache → RAM → NVMe → SSD
   → HDD) is designed for exactly this workload pattern.

6. **10 Gbps NIC is the federation backbone.** AlphaFold at 23 TB would take ~5 hours at
   wire speed (realistically 8-12 hours with overhead). Cross-gate federation at 10G means
   strandGate can stream CAS objects from westGate at near-local speeds.
