# blueGate Wave 157e — Phase 2 Deploy AAR

**Date**: Aug 10, 2026 | **Wave**: 157e | **Gate**: blueGate (Windows x86_64)
**Operator**: blueGate sub-builder | **From**: overwatch (eastGate)
**Status**: **PHASE 2 DEPLOYED**

---

## Summary

blueGate Phase 2 deployment complete. NUCLEUS 13/13 alive on 157e depot binaries. `builder.serve` validated on `:9800` with JSON-RPC health response. Golgi SSH authorized and SCP verified E2E. `plasmid.harvest --local` operational. DNS proxy (G29 Phase 2) still running. All prior blockers resolved.

---

## What Worked

### 1. Depot Pull — Clean

4/15 binaries updated from golgi depot (toadStool, barraCuda, biomeOS, sourDough). Remaining 11 unchanged since last pull. No file-locking issues — NUCLEUS stopped cleanly before pull.

### 2. NUCLEUS Restart — 13/13 First Try

All 13 primals started cleanly on the first attempt. No stale PID file issues this wave (cleanup from prior waves persisted). songBird PID path at `C:\ProgramData\songbird\songbird-blueGate.pid` — known and pre-cleaned.

### 3. Golgi SSH — AUTHORIZED

The blocker from Wave 157b (blueGate SSH key not authorized on golgi) has been resolved by sporeGate. Verified:
- `ssh golgi` connects as `root` to `157.230.3.183`
- SCP file transfer confirmed E2E
- Depot directory visible at `/opt/ecoPrimals/plasmidBin/primals/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/`

### 4. builder.serve — JSON-RPC Validated

`membrane.exe builder.serve --port 9800` runs and responds:
```json
{"method":"health","result":{"message":"builder OK (blueGate)","ok":true}}
```
Gate identity correctly detected as "blueGate". JSON-RPC protocol operational.

### 5. plasmid.harvest — Operational

`plasmid.harvest --local --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --primal skunkbat --dry-run` returns correctly structured build plan. Local harvest from source repos confirmed working.

### 6. Repo Cascade — 10/17 Updated

Pulled from Forgejo (`git.primals.eco`). 10 repos received new commits, 6 already current, 1 (swarmVine) errored on pull (pre-existing divergence).

## What Didn't Work / Known Issues

### P2: petalTongue Port Binding

petalTongue process is ALIVE but `:9204` remains closed. This is the same P2 from Wave 157b — petalTongue in `server` mode ignores `--port` and binds to an ephemeral port. Non-blocking for Phase 2 validation (petalTongue uses internal IPC), but needs upstream fix.

**Recommendation**: petalTongue `server` subcommand needs `--port` flag honored. Currently binds to ephemeral port instead of specified `:9204`.

### swarmVine Pull Failure

`git pull` on swarmVine failed — pre-existing local changes from the platform porting attempt in Wave 157b (TCP fallback patches). These were reverted locally but the branch may be in a dirty state.

**Recommendation**: Force-reset swarmVine to `origin/main` on next clean deploy.

### biomeOS /health Response

`/health` endpoint returns an empty string `""` instead of a structured JSON response. Previous waves returned structured health. This may be a regression in biomeOS 4.57.0 or a timing issue.

**Recommendation**: biomeOS `/health` should return `{"status":"ok","version":"4.57.0","gate":"blueGate"}` or similar structured response.

### builder.serve Method Surface

Only `health` method discovered. The following returned "unknown builder method":
- `builder.health`, `builder.capabilities`, `builder.targets`, `builder.list`, `builder.queue`, `builder.info`

The builder RPC surface appears minimal. sporeGate dispatch may need to know what methods are available for remote build triggering.

**Recommendation**: Document `builder.serve` RPC method surface. If dispatch is SSH-based (as per J12 wire), JSON-RPC may be for health-only while actual builds are triggered via SSH + `plasmid.harvest`.

## Windows-Specific Notes for This Wave

1. **No regressions from 157b**: All Windows-specific workarounds from prior waves still hold (TCP bind mode, PID file cleanup, binary renaming for locked files).
2. **Port 9800 squatter**: A stale `membrane.exe` instance was occupying `:9800` from a prior session. Had to kill PID before `builder.serve` could bind. Windows doesn't auto-clean orphaned processes on logout like systemd does.
3. **biomeOS 4.57.0**: New depot binary (20,314 KB). No functional regressions observed beyond the `/health` response format change.

## Resolved Blockers (from 157b)

| Blocker | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Golgi SSH key not authorized | **RESOLVED** — sporeGate added blueGate key |
| membrane.exe depot push | **RESOLVED** — SCP pipe verified, `plasmid.harvest` works |
| swarmVine UDS porting | **UPSTREAM** — 5 call sites need `#[cfg(unix)]` + TCP fallback |

---

## Recommendations to Overwatch

1. **petalTongue `--port` fix**: P2 priority. Port binding in `server` mode is ignored on all platforms (not Windows-specific).
2. **biomeOS `/health` schema**: Return structured JSON from `/health` endpoint for monitoring tooling.
3. **builder.serve RPC docs**: Document available methods. If dispatch is SSH+harvest, clarify that JSON-RPC is health-only.
4. **swarmVine Windows port**: 5 UDS call sites need platform guards. Pattern exists from songBird fix. Moderate effort.
5. **Process management on Windows**: Consider `membrane.exe` daemon mode with proper PID tracking to prevent stale process squatting.
