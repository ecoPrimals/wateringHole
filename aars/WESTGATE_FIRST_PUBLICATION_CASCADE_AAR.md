# AAR: westGate Post-Threshold + First Publication Cascade

**Date**: Aug 1, 2026 16:00 EDT
**Gate**: westGate
**Wave**: 155n post-threshold
**Author**: westGate overwatch (agent-assisted)
**biomeOS**: v4.56.0 (3h 38m uptime post-reboot, 13/13 active)

---

## TL;DR

Major cascade absorbed: 5 repos with upstream changes. Headline items: first arXiv draft
scaffolded (SU(2) lattice QCD on consumer GPU), pseudoSpore LIVE on primals.eco, sporePrint
demonstration era (334→190 pages, hype cleaned), hotSpring v0.6.32 (deep debt clear, 627
tests). westGate ZFS pool re-imported after machine reboot — zero data errors, all 41 GB /
4,754 CAS objects intact. Auto-import cachefile set to prevent future manual re-import.

### arXiv Draft — First ecoPrimals Publication

`whitePaper/subGen/LATTICE_QCD_CONSUMER_GPU_ARXIV.md`

- **Title**: "Vendor-Agnostic Lattice QCD on Consumer GPUs via WebGPU/WGSL with Cryptographic Provenance"
- **Target**: arXiv hep-lat (primary), cs.DC (cross-list)
- **Structure**: Abstract, Introduction, Method (gauge theory, DF64, shader pipeline, provenance), Results (lattice scaling, plaquette, precision, multi-vendor, autocorrelation), Discussion (cost, limitations, vendor neutrality), Reproducibility, Conclusion
- **Done**: Everything except 5 data sections marked `[TODO]` — all owned by hotSpring/strandGate
- **Key result already in**: 38-58× GPU speedup, 5,500 trajectories/hour on RTX 3090 (16⁴)
- **Cost comparison**: ~$0.03 amortized vs ~$55 on AWS p4d.24xlarge for 10K trajectories

The 5 `[TODO]` sections need:
1. Plaquette ⟨P⟩ values at β=2.3 for 8⁴ and 16⁴
2. DF64 vs f64 ULP comparison
3. AMD RX 6950 XT benchmarks (vendor-agnostic proof)
4. Integrated autocorrelation time τ_int
5. References (population during submission prep)

### Publication Pipeline Standard

`wateringHole/protocols/PUBLICATION_PIPELINE_STANDARD.md` — reusable pattern for all
ecoPrimals publications. Two-track model: sporePrint owns structure/framing/reproducibility,
science team fills `[TODO]` markers with measured data. Neither blocks the other.

### sporePrint Demonstration Era

- 334→190 active pages (144 foundation-flagged, URLs preserved)
- 20 files hype-cleaned (353× → topology, 3.24 TFLOPS → 2,130 matmul/sec)
- pseudoSpore catalog page LIVE at primals.eco/pseudospore/
- Live dashboards spec ready (pending petalTongue G19)
- Publication scaffold: reusable checklist for arXiv papers

### hotSpring v0.6.32 — Deep Debt Clear

- thiserror migration complete
- serve.rs refactored
- cazyme-fel staging code added (types.rs, validation.rs)
- 627 tests, 0 clippy warnings
- Handoff document shipped for overwatch audit

## westGate Infrastructure

### ZFS Pool Recovery

Machine rebooted at some point (biomeOS uptime 3h 38m, previously 17h+). The ZFS pool
did not auto-import because `cachefile` was not set.

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| ZFS pool not auto-imported | `sudo zpool import nestgate` |
| Prevent future occurrences | `sudo zpool set cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache nestgate` |

**Result**: Zero data errors, all 41 GB intact, 4,754 CAS objects verified.

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| biomeOS | v4.56.0, Coordinated, 487 caps |
| Uptime | 3h 38m (post-reboot) |
| Services | 13/13 active |
| Sockets | 17 (regenerating post-reboot) |
| ZFS pool | ONLINE, 0 errors, 41.6 GB used, 50.7 TB available |
| CAS objects | 4,754 |
| Datasets | 10 (ChEMBL, LINCS, GTEx, UniProt, ZINC, SILVA, MassBank, PhysioNet, NOAA, LTEE) |

### PDB Bulk Rsync

The PDB bulk rsync process that was running died with the reboot. It had downloaded ~2.4 GB
of ~60 GB. Will need to be restarted. rsync is idempotent — it will resume from where it
left off.

## Observations

1. **The arXiv draft is real.** Clean structure, solid abstract, existing benchmark data
   (38-58× speedup). The 5 TODO sections are well-defined and all owned by one team
   (hotSpring/strandGate). This is an executable publication path, not a placeholder.

2. **Publication pipeline standard is the right pattern.** Two-track model prevents blocking.
   sporePrint can scaffold any number of papers in parallel while science teams fill data.
   westGate's role is data federation support and pseudoSpore artifact verification.

3. **ZFS auto-import needs to be set at pool creation.** This was a 30-second fix but it
   meant the pool was offline for ~3.5 hours during the reboot cycle. Data was safe
   (ZFS is designed for this) but services couldn't access CAS until manual intervention.

4. **sporePrint hype cleanup is significant.** Going from 334 to 190 active pages, removing
   inflated claims (353× → topology, 3.24 TFLOPS → 2,130 matmul/sec measured), is the
   kind of credibility engineering that makes the arXiv submission viable. You can't submit
   to hep-lat with a website claiming unmeasured TFLOPS.

## Planned Service Interruption (Aug 2)

The blurb notes a planned eastGate interruption: ATT gateway + DS224+ moving to basement.
This may cause Ethernet disruption across the mesh. westGate should be unaffected (different
physical location) but Forgejo pushes may fail during the window. Plan: queue commits locally
and push after connectivity restores.

*Cascade absorbed. First arXiv draft scaffolded. pseudoSpore LIVE. ZFS recovered — zero
data loss. 41 GB sovereign data at 100% provenance. Publication pipeline established.
The ecosystem is producing publishable science.*
