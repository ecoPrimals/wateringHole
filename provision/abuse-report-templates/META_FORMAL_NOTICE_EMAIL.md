## III. Duration and Scale of Violation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Observation period** | October 5-7, 2026 (1.6 days of logged evidence) |
| **Total fleet requests** | 88,751 |
| **Unique fleet IPs** | 292 (growing — was 152 on Oct 5) |
| **Direct Meta IPs** | 66 (43% of fleet from FB-BLOCK and FACEBOOK-INC) |
| **Data consumed** | 1.15 GB |
| **Peak velocity** | 7,266 requests/hour (121/min) |
| **Request timing** | 100ms metronomic intervals (99.3% at 0.0-0.1s) |
| **robots.txt compliance** | Zero — read and violated |
| **403 responses honored** | Zero — scraping continues after explicit denial |
| **Behavioral subgroups** | 47 distinct scraping configurations |
| **Countries involved** | 13+ (residential proxy rotation) |
| **Real code obtained** | 0 bytes (defensive systems serve fabricated content) |

The fleet is **accelerating**: 157 requests on day 1, 18,261 on day 2, 70,333 on day 3.

## IV. Laws and Licenses Violated

### A. Copyright / License Violations

| License/Statute | Violation | Evidence |

| **AGPL-3.0-or-later, Section 5** | Modified or derivative works not released under AGPL | If extracted code was used in LLaMA or any Meta AI system, the derivative work must be AGPL-licensed |
| **ORC License** | Mechanics and system designs extracted without ORC compliance | wateringHole repository (13.5% of fleet requests) contains licensed game mechanics and system designs |
| **CC-BY-SA-4.0** | Documentation extracted without attribution or share-alike | sporePrint content, methodology papers, and science publications are CC-BY-SA-4.0 |
| **17 U.S.C. § 1202 (DMCA)** | Circumventing copyright management information | License headers present in every file; extracted without compliance |

### B. Computer Fraud / Unauthorized Access

| **StGB § 202a** | Germany | Unauthorized access to data (Ausspähen von Daten) — if Hetzner layer is targeted |
| **Code pénal Art. 323-1** | France | Fraudulent access to an automated data processing system — if OVH layer is targeted |

### C. Trademark Impersonation

| Statute | Violation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **15 U.S.C. § 1125 (Lanham Act)** | False designation of origin | Every request contains 6 trademarked product names: Chrome™, Safari™, Edge™, macOS™, Intel™, Windows™ — none of which are the actual client |

### D. Data Protection

| Framework | Violation | Entity |
|---|---|---|
| **GDPR Art. 5** | Automated data collection without legal basis | Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (Irish entity) |

## V. Behavioral Evidence Summary

The fleet exhibits six **conserved behavioral epitopes** — signatures that cannot change without replacing the scraping toolkit entirely:

1. **`header_poverty`** (100% of fleet): Missing `Sec-Fetch-Mode` header — mandatory in Chrome since 2019
2. **`stale_chrome`** (100%): Chrome/150 User-Agent string — current stable is Chrome/155
3. **`connection_absent`** (100%): No `Connection: keep-alive` header — Chrome always sends this
4. **`content_gate`** (99%): >50% of requests target `/commit/`, `/src/`, `/raw/`, `/blame/` paths
5. **`accept_monoculture`** (89%): Universal `*/*` Accept header — browsers vary by resource type
6. **`blame_ratio`** (67%): >10% of requests target `/blame/` paths — **author attribution mining**

The `blame_ratio` epitope is particularly significant: 67% of fleet subgroups systematically scrape `/blame/` endpoints, which show who last modified each line of code. This is author attribution mining at scale — mapping authorship for use in training data pipelines.

## VI. What We Require

1. **Immediate cessation** of all unauthorized scraping from FB-BLOCK (57.141.0.0/13), FACEBOOK-INC (173.252.0.0/16), and all associated proxy infrastructure.

2. **AGPL compliance audit**: Identify all derivative works, training datasets, model weights, and internal tools that contain or were influenced by code extracted from primals.eco infrastructure. Either:
   - (a) Purge all extracted material and provide auditable proof; **or**
   - (b) Release all derivative works under AGPL-3.0-or-later, as the license requires.

3. **Written confirmation** within 30 days that the above actions have been taken.
