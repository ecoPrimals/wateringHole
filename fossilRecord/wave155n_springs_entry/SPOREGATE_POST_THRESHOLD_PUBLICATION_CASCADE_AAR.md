# sporeGate AAR — Post-Threshold Publication Cascade (Aug 1, 2026)

**Date**: August 1, 2026 (afternoon)
**Wave**: Post-155n (Springs+Gardens Phase — Publication Track)
**Gate**: sporeGate (build authority, depot, DNS/DHCP, cascade hub)
**Posture**: Infrastructure verified green. G29 COMPLETE (3-way DNS). Publication pipeline absorbed. Ready for Aug 2 service interruption.

## Cascade Review

Absorbed 7 new commits from fleet. Key new material:

| Source | What | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| sporePrint | Demonstration era AAR — 334→190 pages, hype cleaned, pseudoSpore LIVE | Publication pipeline operational |
| strandGate | Post-threshold Node Atomic AAR — GPU HMC 38-58× speedup, shader pipeline proven | arXiv data source confirmed |
| westGate | Data federation batch 1 — 38.2 GB, 4,752 CAS objects, LINCS L1000 | tideGlass unblocked |
| blueGate | G29 H2 DNS secondary LIVE — dnsproxy on 192.168.4.210:53 | 3-way DNS redundancy COMPLETE |
| hotSpring | Deep debt modernization handoff — 627 tests, 0 clippy, thiserror migration | QCD codebase ready for production |
| Protocol | Publication Pipeline Standard — two-track (science + sporePrint) pattern | First publication workflow codified |
| Handoff | hotSpring QCD → arXiv — 5 [TODO] sections for strandGate to fill | arXiv scaffold READY |

## Infrastructure Verification

### All Green

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| dnsmasq | active, watchdog enabled, redundant upstreams |
| stubby | active, DoT to Cloudflare + Quad9 |
| WG mesh | connected, handshake 2min ago |
| Depot | 19 binaries, integrity verified |
| golgi mesh DNS (10.13.37.1) | active 6h, no conflicts |
| golgi Caddy (sporeprint, depot, git) | HTTP 200 across all services |
| blueGate H2 DNS (G29) | LIVE (deployed by blueGate team) |
| LAN gates | 6/6 reachable (eastGate, ironGate, northGate, strandGate, Omada, MikroTik) |

### G29 Peptidoglycan — COMPLETE

3-way DNS redundancy now operational:

```
Path 1 (primary):   DHCP → sporeGate dnsmasq → stubby DoT + fallback
Path 2 (H2 local):  blueGate dnsproxy → sporeGate + Cloudflare
Path 3 (WG mesh):   golgi dnsmasq → DigitalOcean + Cloudflare
```

## Aug 2 Service Interruption Assessment

eastGate is moving ATT gateway + DS224+ to basement. Expected ethernet disruption.

**Impact on sporeGate:**

| What | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Internet link drops | stubby DoT fails, dnsmasq falls back to direct 1.1.1.1 (also fails) | dnsmasq cache serves recent queries; LAN DNS entries (.primals.local) unaffected |
| WG mesh drops | golgi unreachable, no git push/pull, no CI dispatch | LAN-only operations continue normally |
| DHCP/DNS for LAN | Unaffected | Local service, no internet dependency |
| Gate-to-gate comms | Unaffected | All via L2 backbone (MikroTik + Omada) |
| Depot access | LAN gates can still pull from golgi cache if WG was recently alive; HTTPS depot fails | Binaries already deployed on all 5 NUCLEUS gates |

**No action needed** — all DNS hardening from earlier today handles this gracefully. dnsmasq auto-restart ensures recovery when the link comes back.

## golgi DNS/Timer Issue

The blurb flags "sporePrint auto-publish deploys to wrong server" as SHOULD priority owned by eastGate ops. Verified on golgi:

- sporePrint post-receive hook: correctly rebuilds in `/opt/ecoPrimals/sporePrint/public` on golgi
- Caddy: correctly serves `sporeprint.primals.eco` from that directory
- sporePrint site: HTTP 200, pseudoSpore HTTP 200
- Depot: HTTP 200

Infrastructure is healthy. The timer/deploy issue is likely a sporePrint-specific routing or scheduling concern that eastGate ops will address.

## sporeGate Role in Publication Pipeline

Per the new `PUBLICATION_PIPELINE_STANDARD.md`:

| Role | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Build authority (depot, CI) | sporeGate | Operational — 46 binaries, CI dispatching |
| arXiv data fill (5 TODOs) | strandGate/hotSpring | Pending — needs HMC production runs |
| Publication surface | golgi/sporePrint | LIVE — pseudoSpore, verification guide |
| Science data | westGate | 38.2 GB at 100% provenance |

sporeGate's role is steady-state: keep depot/CI healthy while strandGate fills the arXiv data and sporePrint handles publication framing.

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LAN gates reachable | **6/6** |
| golgi services healthy | **All** (Caddy, knotd, dnsmasq, Forgejo) |
| DNS paths operational | **3/3** (sporeGate, blueGate, golgi) |
| Depot integrity | **19 verified, 0 mismatches** |
| Fleet AARs absorbed | **7** |
| New protocols/handoffs | **3** (publication pipeline, QCD handoff, data schedule) |

*Post-threshold + publication phase. Infrastructure green across all layers. G29 COMPLETE. Ready for Aug 2 interruption. First arXiv submission awaiting strandGate HMC data.*
