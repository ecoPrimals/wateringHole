# ironGate Deployment AAR — Wave 155n Publication Phase

**Date**: 2026-08-01 18:31 EDT
**Gate**: ironGate (10.13.37.7)
**Team**: Hardware + Deployment
**Session**: Catch-up sync + full deployment validation
**Duration**: ~25 minutes (Phase 0→1 sync + NUCLEUS validation)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ironGate is **NUCLEUS LIVE** — not merely Tower Atomic as previously tracked.
All 13 primals deployed from depot. 21/21 IPC sockets healthy. GPU online.
913 garden tests pass locally. Dev loop to golgi validated. Ready for code
teams to build on.

## WHAT WE DID

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Phase 0: SSH connectivity | Authenticated as `golgiAdmin` / key `irongate` on port 2222 |
| Phase 1a: Naming fixes | None needed — all camelCase, no symlinks, all on `main` |
| Phase 1b: Repoint remotes | 24 repos GitHub → Forgejo SSH. 6 springs recloned (shallow roots) |
| Phase 1c: Clone missing | 5 repos: `helixVision`, `metalForge`, `blueFish`, `rustChip`, `fossilRecord` |
| Phase 1d: Pull all | 37/37 canonical repos current with origin/main |
| Phase 2: Enrollment | Already complete — WireGuard LIVE, Tower deployed prior |
| Hostname | Set from `pop-os` → `ironGate` via `hostnamectl` |
| NUCLEUS validation | `biomeos doctor` → 21/21 HEALTHY |
| Garden builds | esotericWebb + projectFOUNDATION + lithoSpore: compile clean, 913 tests pass |

## GARDEN READINESS (for code teams)

| Garden | Tests | Build | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| esotericWebb | 472 pass | clean | V22. G20 target. GAP-002 resolved on Webb side. |
| projectFOUNDATION | 199 pass | clean | Wave 132f. 6 crates. |
| lithoSpore | 242 pass | clean | pseudoSpore lifecycle integrated. |
| projectNUCLEUS | — (deploy/infra) | n/a | Gate profile current. 17 graphs. |

## DIVERGENCES FROM BLURB

| Blurb Said | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| ironGate: "Tower Atomic" | **Full NUCLEUS** — 13/13 deployed, 21/21 sockets |
| "Deploying ProjectNUCLEUS + esotericWebb" | Already deployed — builds + tests pass |
| GPU: RTX 5070 (noted in gate profile) | Confirmed: RTX 5070, CUDA 12.8, 12 GB |

---

## NON-BLOCKING WARNINGS

1. **biomeOS standalone mode** — no `FAMILY_ID` or `config.toml`. Fine for dev. Needs enrollment config for production mesh participation.
2. **plasmidBin path not linked** — `biomeos doctor` expects a local plasmidBin directory. Cosmetic.
3. **2 slim-archive dirs** in `infra/` — old GitHub artifacts. Can delete.
4. **`sort-after/`** — contains `ionChannel` (unknown) and old `rustChip` duplicate.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERWATCH

1. **Update gate fleet table**: ironGate is NUCLEUS, not Tower Atomic.
2. **Code teams can begin immediately** on esotericWebb (G20) — NUCLEUS substrate is live, garden compiles, 472 tests pass.
3. **GPU workloads ready** — RTX 5070 available for coralReef shader compilation, toadStool compute dispatch, esotericWebb rendering via petalTongue.
4. **Optional**: enroll ironGate with FAMILY_ID for production mesh identity (requires eastGate guidance on family seed).

---

## WHAT'S NEXT (hardware team)

- Monitor NUCLEUS socket stability under code team workloads
- Depot binary freshness check (are we on latest depot versions?)
- esotericWebb live composition validation (petalTongue → GPU rendering path)
- Support planned service interruption (Aug 2, ATT gateway move)
