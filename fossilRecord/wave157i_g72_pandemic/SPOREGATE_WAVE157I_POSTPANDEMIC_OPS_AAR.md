# sporeGate Wave 157i — Post-Pandemic Enmeshment Ops AAR

**Date**: Aug 11, 2026 | **Gate**: sporeGate (foreman) | **Wave**: 157i
**Scope**: Topology owner ops — cascade, depot, graftGate enmeshment, sub-mesh evolution

---

## Summary

sporeGate completed all Phase 1 topology-owner tasks for Wave 157i post-pandemic enmeshment. The fleet is cascade-current, depot is rebuilt and pushed, graftGate is fully enmeshed (WG + Forgejo SSH + org access), and the sub-mesh topology has been evolved to reflect the actual builder/foreman/CAS pattern.

---

## Completed

### 1. Forgejo Cascade — All Repos Current

Pulled latest from `git.primals.eco` across all local repos. Incoming changes absorbed:

| Repo | Changes |
|------|---------|
| wateringHole | CASCADE HANDOFF blurb, piGate/riscGate hardware profiles |
| swarmVine | Deep debt (hostname→pure Rust), socket consolidation, G72 Tier 1 |
| sourDough | `validate deps` G72 pandemic detector, sovereign CI pipeline, template refactor |
| primalSpring | graftGate bootstrap specs, NUCLEUS lab integration, workload definitions |

All other primals (bearDog, songBird, toadStool, nestGate, etc.) already up to date.

### 2. Jelly String Excision — Committed & Pushed (5 repos)

Committed and pushed the Wave 157h jelly-string-excision changes that were staged locally:

| Repo | Changes | Commit |
|------|---------|--------|
| cellMembrane | freshness→wave.toml, MESH_REGISTRY deprecated, golgi DNS | `defeb08` |
| plasmidBin | 22 scripts fossilized, DEPRECATED.md migration map, profile DNS | `5944c86` |
| wateringHole | freshness.toml removed, 13 Python scripts fossilized | `f0ef5d7` |
| primalSpring | freshness cleanup, topology deprecation header | `da0a395` |
| petalTongue | Duplicate manifest removed + mp3 placeholder after blob filter | `3ba1a59`, `c8afcd9` |

### 3. graftGate Enmeshment — Phase 1 Complete

| Task | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| Forgejo user created | DONE | `graftgate` user, added to all 4 org Owner teams |
| SSH key registered | DONE | `SHA256:AMpmsMVodQcZAsZCimjf17JrupbItngaC92TopWDDz4` (id=19) |
| HTTPS token generated | DONE | Push confirmed by graftGate (`73d76ae0`) |
| WG peer on golgiBody | DONE | `ekHFlu0N...` → `10.13.37.13/32`, persisted in `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` |
| golgiBody SSH authorized | DONE | graftGate ed25519 key added to root `authorized_keys` for SCP depot push |
| Darwin depot dir | DONE | `aarch64-apple-darwin/` created on golgiBody, writable |
| sporePrint access | DONE | `ecoPrimals/sporePrint` (private): `push: true` confirmed for graftgate |
| Manifest updated | DONE | darwinGate→graftGate, WG IP, 15/15 stats, 14 repos |
| MESH_REGISTRY updated | DONE | graftGate `10.13.37.13` + darwinGate alias + WAN zone |
| TOPOLOGY_MAP updated | DONE | graftGate in WireGuard + songbird meshes |

### 4. Depot Rebuild & Push

- Local depot: **13/13 primals current, 0 stale, 0 VPS skew**
- petalTongue rebuilt after mp3 placeholder fix (blob filter casualty from Wave 157g)
- Full depot push to golgiBody: **37 binaries synced across 4 architectures**
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`: 19 files, 176M
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`: 14 files, 138M
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`: 14 files, 143M
  - `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`: 29 files, 313M
  - `aarch64-apple-darwin`: empty (awaiting graftGate push of 15 binaries, ~98.1M)
- BLAKE3 checksums current on golgiBody

### 5. Sub-Mesh Topology Evolution

Reshaped the builder topology from flat "everyone builds" to role-based sub-mesh:

| Role | Gate | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| **Foreman** | sporeGate | Orchestrates fleet, depot authority, peptidoglycan layer. NOT a primary builder. |
| **Workhorse** | ironGate | Primary Linux builder (musl+GNU), GPU/CUDA, HPC, NFT braid CAS compute |
| **Dev** | eastGate | Overwatch, IDE, primalSpring. Build-capable but builds for dev/test, not depot. |
| **CAS Storage** | westGate | Data braid CAS, tiered archival (5×14TB), provenance chain. Paired with ironGate compute. |
| **Windows Builder** | blueGate | Sole Windows compilation authority |
| **Apple Builder** | graftGate | Sole Darwin compilation authority, 15/15 compiled |

Deploy/validate targets: grapheneGate (Android), iosGate (iOS, glacial), southGate (canary).

CAS/provenance duo: ironGate (compute) ↔ westGate (storage).

### 6. Manifest Fixes

- `piGate` mobility `"portable"` → `"mobile"` (Rust enum parse error fixed)
- golgiBody host `157.230.3.183` → `golgi.primals.eco` in topology hosts
- graftGate sub-builder entry for `aarch64-apple-darwin`

### 7. eastGate Cascade

Cascaded all repos to eastGate (overwatch position). 14/14 NUCLEUS primals running, all active. WG mesh: 6 peers reachable.

## State After This Wave

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Depot | 13/13 current, 0 stale, 5 architectures (darwin awaiting graftGate push) |
| Forgejo | All excision + enmeshment commits pushed. graftGate fully enmeshed. |
| Mesh | graftGate WG LIVE at .13. 5-gate gossip mesh. |
| Topology | Sub-mesh roles formalized: foreman/workhorse/dev/CAS/platform-builders |
| eastGate | Cascaded, 14/14 NUCLEUS running, overwatch ready |
