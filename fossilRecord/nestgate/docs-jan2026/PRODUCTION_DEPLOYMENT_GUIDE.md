```

##### Phase 2: Gradual Traffic Migration (2-4 hours)
```bash
# 1. Route 10% traffic to blue
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --blue 10 --green 90

# 2. Monitor for 30 minutes
# - Check error rates
# - Check response times
# - Check resource usage

# 3. Gradually increase if stable
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --blue 25 --green 75  # 30 min
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --blue 50 --green 50  # 30 min
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --blue 75 --green 25  # 30 min
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --blue 100 --green 0  # Full cutover
```

##### Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup (1 hour)
```bash
# 1. Validate 100% traffic on blue
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh production

# 2. Monitor for 1 hour

# 3. Decommission green environment
./scripts/decommission.sh green

# 4. Mark deployment complete
./scripts/mark-deployment-complete.sh
```

#### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# IMMEDIATE: Route traffic back to green
./scripts/route-traffic.sh --green 100 --blue 0

# Then investigate and fix issues
./scripts/collect-diagnostics.sh blue
```
