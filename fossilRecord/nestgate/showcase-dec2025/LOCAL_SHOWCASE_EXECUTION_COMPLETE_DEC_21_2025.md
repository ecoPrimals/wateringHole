---

## 🚀 PROGRESSIVE LEARNING PATH

### Completed Levels

**Level 1: Isolated Capabilities** ✅
- Storage Basics: Demonstrated filesystem storage
- Capability Discovery: Demonstrated runtime introspection
- **Takeaway**: NestGate is fully functional alone

**Level 2: Ecosystem Integration (Degradation)** ✅
- BearDog Discovery: Demonstrated graceful fallback
- **Takeaway**: NestGate adapts to available services

**Level 2: Ecosystem Integration (Full)** ⚠️ Ready
- BearDog BTSP: Ready to test when BearDog is running
- **Requirement**: Start BearDog BTSP server on port 9000
- **Command**: `cd ../beardog && BTSP_PORT=9000 ./target/release/examples/btsp_server`

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Showcase Runner Features

**Automated execution**:
```bash
cd showcase
./run_showcase_simple.sh
```

**What it does**:
1. Creates timestamped output directory
2. Runs all Level 1 demos (isolated)
3. Tests graceful degradation (Level 2.1)
4. Checks for BearDog availability
5. Runs BTSP demo if BearDog present
6. Generates comprehensive report

**Output**:
```
full_showcase_output-<timestamp>/
├── REPORT.txt                    # Summary report
├── 01_storage_basics.log         # Demo logs
├── 03_capability_discovery.log
└── 01_beardog_discovery.log
```

### Fixed Issues

**Issue**: Demo scripts had incorrect `PROJECT_ROOT` path calculation
- **Problem**: `../../../../..` went to `/path/to/ecoPrimals` (parent workspace)
- **Fix**: Changed to `../../../..` to stay in `/path/to/ecoPrimals/nestgate`
- **Impact**: Demos now run correctly from showcase runner

- Break when dependencies missing

**NestGate showcase**:
- Shows isolated AND integrated scenarios
- Tests graceful degradation explicitly
- Works with or without dependencies
- **Progressive**: Learn from simple to complex

   ```

2. **Run showcase again**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ecoPrimals/nestgate/showcase
   ./run_showcase_simple.sh
   ```

3. **Expected**: All 4 demos pass (including BTSP communication)

### Future Enhancements
