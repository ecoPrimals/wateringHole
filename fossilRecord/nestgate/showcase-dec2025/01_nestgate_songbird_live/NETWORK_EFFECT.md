# Dynamic Federation: The Network Effect

**Date**: December 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ARCHITECTURE DEFINED

## 🌐 The Problem with Hardcoded Topology

### Before (Hardcoded):
```yaml
towers:
  westgate:
    endpoint: "http://localhost:7200"
    role: "cold-storage"
  northgate:
    endpoint: "http://localhost:7201"
    role: "failover"
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ Must update config when adding/removing nodes
- ❌ Doesn't adapt to failures automatically
- ❌ Brittle: breaks if endpoints change
- ❌ Doesn't scale: manual coordination required
- ❌ No network effect: isolated configuration

## 🎯 The Solution: Service Discovery via Songbird

### After (Dynamic):
```yaml
discovery:
  primal_type: "nestgate"
  required_capabilities: ["storage"]
  
tower_selection:
  primary:
    prefer_capabilities: ["cold-storage", "large-scale"]
    fallback: "highest-capacity"
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Zero configuration: nodes self-register
- ✅ Automatic adaptation: discovers live nodes
- ✅ Resilient: tolerates endpoint changes
- ✅ Scalable: works with 1 to N nodes
- ✅ Network effect: federation grows organically

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. NestGate Tower Startup

When a NestGate tower starts:

```rust
// On startup, register with Songbird
let registration = ServiceRegistration {
    primal_name: "nestgate",
    instance_name: "westgate",  // Human-readable name
    endpoint: discover_my_endpoint(),  // Auto-detect
    capabilities: vec!["storage", "cold-storage"],
    metadata: {
        "role": "primary",
        "capacity_gb": 10000,
    },
    heartbeat_interval_sec: 30,
};

songbird_client.register(registration).await?;
```

**Key Points**:
- No hardcoded endpoints in workflow
- Tower knows its own capabilities
- Songbird learns about the tower dynamically

### 2. Songbird Service Registry

Songbird maintains a **live registry** of all services:

```
GET /api/v1/services/discover?primal=nestgate&capability=storage

Response:
{
  "services": [
    {
      "instance_name": "westgate",
      "endpoint": "http://192.0.2.100:7200",
      "capabilities": ["storage", "cold-storage", "large-scale"],
      "healthy": true,
      "last_heartbeat": "2025-12-21T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "instance_name": "stradgate",
      "endpoint": "http://192.0.2.101:7202",
      "capabilities": ["storage", "replication", "backup"],
      "healthy": true,
      "last_heartbeat": "2025-12-21T12:00:05Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Workflow Execution

When a workflow runs:

1. **Discovery Phase**:
   ```yaml
   - name: "discover-towers"
     action:
       type: "service-discovery"
       query:
         primal: "nestgate"
         capabilities: ["storage"]
         min_healthy: 1
   ```

2. **Capability-Based Selection**:
   ```yaml
   - name: "store-to-primary"
     tower: "${select_tower(prefer_capabilities=['cold-storage'])}"
   ```
   
   Songbird automatically selects `westgate` because it has `cold-storage` capability.

3. **Dynamic Replication**:
   ```yaml
   - name: "replicate-to-backup"
     tower: "${select_tower(prefer_capabilities=['replication'], exclude=[primary])}"
   ```
   
   Songbird selects `stradgate` because it has `replication` capability and isn't the primary.

## 🎓 The Network Effect

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Tower

**New tower joins**:
```bash
# Southgate starts up
nestgate service start --port 7204

# Automatically registers with Songbird
# No workflow changes needed!
```

**Result**:
- Southgate appears in service registry
- Next workflow run discovers it automatically
- Can be used for additional replication
- Zero configuration changes

### Scenario 2: Tower Failure

**Westgate (primary) goes down**:
```bash
# Westgate crashes or is taken offline
```

**Automatic adaptation**:
1. Songbird marks Westgate as unhealthy (missed heartbeats)
2. Next workflow run discovers only healthy nodes
3. Stradgate is promoted to primary (has storage capability)
4. Workflow continues without manual intervention

### Scenario 3: Dynamic Scaling

**Federation grows organically**:

```
Day 1: Westgate (1 node)
  ↓
Day 2: Westgate + Stradgate (2 nodes, automatic replication)
  ↓
Day 3: + Northgate (3 nodes, automatic sharding)
  ↓
Day 4: + Eastgate (4 nodes, load balancing)
```

**No configuration file updates needed at any step!**

### 🎯 Next Steps (NestGate Side)

1. **Auto-Registration on Startup**:
   ```rust
   // nestgate/src/service.rs
   async fn start_service(config: Config) -> Result<()> {
       // Start HTTP server
       let server = start_api_server(&config).await?;
       
       // Register with Songbird
       if let Some(songbird_url) = &config.songbird_url {
           register_with_songbird(songbird_url, &config).await?;
           start_heartbeat_loop(songbird_url, &config).spawn();
       }
       
       server.await
   }
   ```

2. **Heartbeat Implementation**:
   ```rust
   async fn start_heartbeat_loop(songbird_url: &str, config: &Config) {
       let mut interval = tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_secs(30));
       loop {
           interval.tick().await;
           let _ = send_heartbeat(songbird_url, &config.instance_id).await;
       }
   }
   ```

## 🎉 The Power of Network Effects

**Traditional Federation** (Hardcoded):
```
Value = N nodes
(Linear growth, manual coordination)
```

**Dynamic Federation** (Service Discovery):
```
Value = N² connections
(Exponential growth, automatic coordination)
```

**Why**:
- Each node can discover and connect to any other
- No central authority managing topology
- Organic growth as nodes join
- Self-healing as nodes fail
- Load distributes automatically

## 📖 Key Takeaways

1. **No Hardcoded Topology**: Workflows use capabilities, not names
2. **Self-Registration**: Towers register themselves on startup
3. **Service Discovery**: Songbird maintains live registry
4. **Capability-Based Selection**: Choose nodes by what they can do
5. **Network Effect**: Federation value grows exponentially

**This is the future of ecoPrimals federation.**

Every primal can use this pattern:
- BearDog security nodes
- ToadStool compute nodes
- Squirrel AI nodes
- NestGate storage nodes

All discovering each other dynamically via Songbird's service registry.

**Zero hardcoded topology. Pure network effect.**
