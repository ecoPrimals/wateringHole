# Wave 108 — Ecosystem Blurb

**Date**: 2026-06-11 07:00 EDT
**From**: eastGate overwatch
**FRAGO**: `impulses/active/2026-06-09T23-15_eastGate__wave106-cross-topology-validation.toml`

---

## State

Zero P1. Zero known debt. 13/13 primals clean. grapheneGate **13/13 deployed and alive** on Pixel 8a. VPS songbird **restarted** (fresh binary, port 7700 confirmed). S1-S4 graduated. **5-gate ecosystem** (eastGate, golgiBody, ironGate, southGate, grapheneGate). **1 P2** (flockGate WAN re-test). **18 LOW**.

---

## Completed This Wave

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **grapheneGate 13/13** | aarch64 rebuilt, deployed via `deploy_pixel.sh`, all 13 confirmed alive (pgrep + TCP + JSON-RPC). AAR published with 7 evolution gaps. |
| **VPS songbird restart** | Stale process killed, fresh binary running (PIDs 645362/645363), port 7700 reachable. |
| **BM-UDS-01** | biomeOS v4.20+v4.21 — all bind paths guard `tcp_only`. |
| **NDK pipeline** | `aarch64-linux-android` cross-compile operational on peptidoglycan. |
| **primalSpring deep debt** | Typed errors (RegistryError, SpawnError), 48x format idiom cleanup. |

## Remaining Work

### P2: flockGate WAN re-test

VPS songbird was restarted after flockGate's failed attempts. flockGate needs to re-test now that the process is fresh.

**Owner**: flockGate ops

```
mesh.init to 157.230.3.183:7700
→ verify latency_ms non-null (~30ms)
→ verify discovery.peers shows eastGate
→ 5/5 WAN e2e → stadial criterion 4 VALIDATED
```

If still failing: file impulse with error details (port, latency, peers output).

### LOW (18 total)

| Item | Owner | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| `SOURDOUGH-SEGFAULT` | sourDough | `validate depot` segfault. b3sum fallback. |
| `PB-FORWARD-01` | cellMembrane | ADB port conflict in deploy_pixel.sh |
| `BEARDOG-ACME` | cellMembrane + bearDog | TlsProvider wired, awaiting ACME client |
| `FORGEJO-CI-EVAL` | cellMembrane | CI pipeline evaluating |
| `INFERENCE-NAMESPACE` | ecosystem | Canonical method namespace TBD |
| healthSpring upstream (15) | various | 2 MEDIUM, 13 LOW — stable workarounds |

## Evolution Gaps (from grapheneGate AAR)

The 13/13 deploy exposed 7 abstraction gaps toward guideStone-grade deterministic deployment:

| Gap | Summary | Owner |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 1 | No standard primal startup contract — each primal has unique CLI/env | primalSpring + primals |
| 2 | No platform capability auto-detection — hardcoded `tcp_only` | primalSpring |
| 3 | Build pipeline fragile — mutable staging, naming mismatches | cellMembrane |
| 4 | deploy_pixel.sh not reusable across gates — gate profiles needed | cellMembrane |
| 5 | No post-deploy validation contract — TCP probe only, no standard health | primalSpring |
| 6 | No on-device orchestration — primals start independently, no composition | biomeOS / primalSpring |
| 7 | BTSP e2e not validated — auth enforcement confirmed, handshake untested | sweetGrass + bearDog |

**Detail**: `AAR_GRAPHENEGATE_WAVE108_13_OF_13_DEPLOYED_JUN10_2026.md`

These are evolution targets, not blockers. Current deployment works.

## Per-Level Summary

| Level | P2 | LOW | Status |
|-------|-----|-----|--------|
| Primals | 0 | 0 | All clear |
| primalSpring | 0 | 1 | 901 tests, 55 scenarios, typed errors evolved |
| Springs | 0 | 15 | healthSpring signal dispatch (downgraded — not blocking) |
| Gates | 1 | 0 | flockGate WAN re-test |
| Gardens | 0 | 2 | BearDog ACME + Forgejo CI |

---

## Ecosystem Vitals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Primals | **13/13 CLEAN** |
| grapheneGate | **13/13 DEPLOYED AND ALIVE** |
| Depot | 14/14 aarch64 + 13/13 x86_64, BLAKE3 verified |
| Mesh | **5-gate** (eastGate↔golgiBody↔ironGate+southGate + grapheneGate standalone) |
| Sovereignty | S1-S4 graduated |
| Tests | 901 lib + 55 scenarios, zero clippy |
| Deployment | Deterministic — gate.bootstrap, depot_sync, mobile fleet |

**grapheneGate is alive. VPS is fresh. One gate left to validate. Seven gaps to evolve.**
