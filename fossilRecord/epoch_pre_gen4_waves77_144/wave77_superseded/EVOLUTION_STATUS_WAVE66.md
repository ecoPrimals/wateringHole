# Evolution Status — Wave 66 Checkpoint

**Date**: 2026-06-01
**Phase**: Shadow validation + non-temporal work sprint
**Authority**: eastGate overwatch
**Prior**: Wave 65 checkpoint (fossilized)

---

## Where We Are

Wave 66 marks the transition from construction to operational validation.
The S1 TLS 7-day shadow has **PASSED** (13 days). wateringHole has been
cleaned to **zero code** — it's now purely comms (manifests, impulses,
handoffs, standards, binary distribution). ironGate delivered deep debt
completion for projectNUCLEUS (235 tests, 9 nucleus-deploy subcommands).
flockGate validated K-Derm relay and cursor hook auto-injection.
The VPS stack runs 20/20 primal membrane services with zero crashes
since the May 28 deployment cycle.

## Known Issues

### Tower Atomic — Songbird Security Provider Socket

Songbird's outbound TLS client (`songbird_http_client::connection::https`) looks for
`/tmp/neural-api-*.sock` instead of using the configured `--security-socket /run/membrane/beardog.sock`.
The beardog socket exists and is healthy. The songbird server code path correctly uses it.
The outbound client code path has a hardcoded neural API socket pattern.

**Fix needed**: `songbird_http_client` must read the security socket from the same
`--security-socket` flag used by the server, or from `BEARDOG_SOCKET` env var.

**Impact**: Cross-gate federation TLS handshakes fail. TURN relay still works.

### biomeOS capability.call Not Implemented

The `capability.call` JSON-RPC method returns `-32601 Method not found`. This blocks
cross-gate capability routing through biomeOS.

**Fix needed**: Implement `capability.call` in biomeOS API server.

### golgiBody Disk Pressure

68% used (6.3G/9.7G). The 20-service primal stack and Forgejo fit but leaves
limited headroom. Consider moving build artifacts to peptidoglycan (9% used, 79G).

## Next Wave Priorities

### Wave 66 (Current) — Shadow Validation Sprint
1. Graduate S1 TLS from shadow to OPERATIONAL
2. wateringHole zero-code cleanup — **DONE**
3. Shadow data collection — **DONE**
4. Fire impulse for songbird socket fix
5. DNS registrar NS cutover (manual)

### Wave 67 — Mesh Connectivity
1. Songbird security socket fix (code)
2. biomeOS capability.call implementation
3. Cross-gate discovery.peers smoke test
4. Deploy Rust relay to peptidoglycan VPS

### Wave 68 — Quorum Phase 1
1. Timer-based potential.sense on VPS nodes
2. S4 formal 7-day gate (if ironGate configured)
3. Family seed deployment to golgiBody

### Wave 69+ — Expansion
1. strandGate deployment
2. northGate deployment
3. Multi-vendor peptidoglycan
4. Forgejo Actions CI

*The ecosystem is in the validation phase. Infrastructure is built, 20 services
are running, S1 TLS is proven. The remaining work is mesh connectivity
(songbird socket fix + capability.call), DNS cutover, and VPS relay deployment.*
