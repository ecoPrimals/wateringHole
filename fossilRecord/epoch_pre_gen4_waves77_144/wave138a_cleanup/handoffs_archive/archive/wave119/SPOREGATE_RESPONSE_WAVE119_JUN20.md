## Executed This Session

### flockGate: 13/13 NUCLEUS (Tower team fixed overnight)

Tower team resolved both known failures:
- `nestgate` — JWT secret configured, now running
- `biomeos` — entrypoint fixed, now running

**flockGate is at full NUCLEUS parity (13/13).** Tower atomic ready for BearDog/Songbird/SkunkBat work.

### golgi: Bridge Services Fixed (0 failed units)

- `membrane-bridge-beardog.service` — restarted (was failed but socket existed)
- `membrane-bridge-biomeos.service` — unit file was missing. Created and enabled.
- **golgi: 0 failed units, 18 membrane services running**

### Depot Integrity: FIXED

Generated `checksums.toml` (BLAKE3) for sporeGate local depot:
- **13/13 verified, 0 hash mismatch, 0 missing**
- `gate.status` now shows `depot.integrity: OK`
- Installed at `~/Development/ecoPrimals/infra/plasmidBin/checksums.toml`

### pepti: Fresh Build Triggered

- Pulled cellMembrane to HEAD (`18627a7` — SSH consolidation, webhook cascade)
- Pulled all 14 primal repos to HEAD
- `build-primal.sh --all --harvest` running (12 drifted primals rebuilding)
- Build in progress — will have fresh binaries for all gates

### Omada SX3008F: Access Confirmed

- **Actual IP: 192.168.4.111** (not .115 as blurb stated)
- Standalone web UI responding at `https://192.168.4.111` (HTTP 200)
- MAC confirmed: `ec:75:0c:4c:98:08`
- Credentials: admin/admin (per whitePaper)
- Ready for VLAN configuration when needed

### Nest Provenance: Ledger Commit #3

- **RhizoCrypt**: New DAG session `019ee4c8...` with 3 vertices (golgi fix, flockGate upgrade, pepti rebuild)
- **LoamSpine**: Sovereign ledger at **height 3** (Genesis + 2 SessionCommits)
- **SweetGrass**: 4 braids total, all witnessed

## Ecosystem State

| Gate | NUCLEUS | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| sporeGate | **13/13** | Reference gate, all probes OK except mesh.init |
| eastGate | **13/13** | Meta atomic, overwatch |
| flockGate | **13/13** | Tower atomic, FULL PARITY achieved |
| golgi | **18 services** | 0 failed, bridges fixed |
| pepti | **building** | Fresh harvest from HEAD in progress |
| ironGate | — | SSH BLOCKED (operator key add needed) |

## Remaining Blockers

| Blocker | Owner | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| ironGate SSH key auth | Operator (RustDesk) | `192.168.4.169`, pubkey needed |
| mesh.init (P2) | sporeGate overwatch | Topology-aware routing setup |
| Flint 2 physical install | Operator | This weekend |

**Key corrections to blurb**:
- Omada SX3008F management IP is `192.168.4.111` (not `.115`)
- flockGate is now 13/13 (not 11/13 — Tower team fixed overnight)
