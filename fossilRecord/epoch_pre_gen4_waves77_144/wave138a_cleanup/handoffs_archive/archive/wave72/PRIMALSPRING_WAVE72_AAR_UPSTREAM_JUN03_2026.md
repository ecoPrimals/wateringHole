# primalSpring Wave 72 — After Action Review (Upstream Dissemination)

**Date**: 2026-06-03
**Author**: eastGate (primalSpring overwatch)
**Audience**: All upstream primal teams
**Wave**: 72
**Status**: P0 mesh PARTIALLY VALIDATED — discovery layer LIVE, dispatch layer BLOCKED on Songbird

---

## TL;DR

First live 2-gate mesh between eastGate and strandGate is operational.
`discovery.peers` works. `mesh.health_check` is bidirectional. Cross-gate
`capability.call` is blocked on a Songbird wire protocol mismatch. DNS
infrastructure is validated and ready for registrar flip. strandGate is
picking up compute trio from paused biomeGate.

---

## What's Working

### 1. Songbird Discovery Layer (LIVE)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peer count | 1 (strand-gate) |
| Quality | 1.0 (direct path, same subnet) |
| Protocols | TCP |
| Health check | Bidirectional healthy |
| Subnet | 192.168.1.0/24 (eastGate .144, strandGate .132) |

```json
{"peers":[{"address":"192.168.1.132:7700","node_id":"strand-gate","quality":1.0,"protocols":["tcp"]}],"total_count":1}
```

`mesh.health_check` from both sides returns `all_healthy: true`.

### 2. BearDog v0.9.0 Cross-Gate Deployment

Successfully deployed eastGate's bearDog binary to strandGate via SCP.
Both gates running Pure Rust HSM (Ed25519, X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Blake3).
Security sockets operational on both gates.

### 3. primalSpring Scenario Infrastructure

`s_covalent_mesh` scenario now runs live against real Songbird instances.
Phase 1 (structural) + Phase 2 (discovery) fully pass. Phase 3 (cross-gate
dispatch) gracefully degrades with informative skip messages.

Updated scenario to accept Songbird's actual wire format (`node_id` field
alongside deprecated `gate` field).

### 4. Capability Discovery via Symlinks

The capability-based discovery system works when standard symlinks exist:
```
/run/user/1000/biomeos/discovery.sock     → songbird.sock
/run/user/1000/biomeos/orchestration.sock → songbird.sock
/run/user/1000/biomeos/security.sock      → beardog-{family}.sock
```

### 5. DNS Sovereign Infrastructure

Both nameservers (ns1: 157.230.3.183, ns2: 137.184.197.151) responding
correctly to A and NS queries. Zone transfer confirmed in sync. Ready
for registrar cutover (operator action only).

### 6. 842 Tests, Zero Clippy, forbid(unsafe_code)

primalSpring v0.9.31 remains at full quality bar. The scenario wire format
fix adds no regressions.

---

## What's Rough

### 1. Songbird `capability.call` Remote Dispatch (P1 BLOCKER)

**Symptom**: `capability.call` to a remote gate returns:
```
No local or remote provider found for capability 'security'
(tried 1 mesh peers via TCP and TURN relay; last error:
Invalid JSON from remote gate: expected value at line 1 column 1)
```

**Root cause**: Songbird's `remote_dispatch.rs` sends raw TCP JSON-RPC frames
to the peer's port 7700. But port 7700 is an HTTP server (axum/hyper). The
peer returns an HTTP status line, which isn't valid JSON.

**Fix needed**: Remote dispatch must HTTP POST to `/jsonrpc` endpoint, not raw TCP.

**Impact**: Cross-gate capability routing is completely non-functional. This
blocks plasmodium collective validation and any multi-gate science dispatch.

### 2. `mesh_seed` Auto-Bootstrap Not Firing (P1)

**Symptom**: Setting `SONGBIRD_PEERS=strand-gate@192.168.1.132:7700` and
`SONGBIRD_NODE_ID=east-gate` before starting Songbird results in:
```
Running in standalone mode (federation disabled)
```
Peers are NOT auto-populated. Manual `mesh.init` RPC is required.

**Root cause**: The `mesh_seed` module exists in source (`songbird-orchestrator`)
but is not wired into the server startup path in binary v0.2.1. The
`federation_setup` code path runs before security initialization and defaults
to standalone when no federation hub is detected.

**Workaround**: Manual RPC after startup:
```json
{"method":"mesh.init","params":{"node_id":"east-gate","bootstrap_peers":[{"node_id":"strand-gate","address":"192.168.1.132:7700"}]}}
```

**Note**: The `bootstrap_peers` parameter must be an **array of objects** with
`node_id` and `address` fields. String format (`["strand-gate@192.168.1.132:7700"]`)
is silently rejected with `bootstrap_peers_added: 0`.

### 3. `latency_ms` Not Populated (P2)

`discovery.peers` returns `latency_ms: null` for all peers. The
`mesh.health_check` also shows `latency_ms: null`. HTTP-based latency
probing (the fix shipped in Songbird's `mesh.probe_latency`) isn't being
invoked during health checks.

### 4. Cross-Subnet Routing (Infra — P2)

southGate (192.168.4.29) is unreachable from eastGate subnet (192.168.1.x).
The Eero mesh bridge does NOT route between VLANs. Options:
- Eero inter-VLAN config (physical operator action)
- TURN relay via VPS (Songbird has `relay.serve`)
- Continue with strandGate (same subnet) as primary partner

Mitigated by using strandGate for initial validation.

### 5. Service Startup Ergonomics (P3)

Starting the mesh requires 5+ manual steps:
1. Start bearDog with correct env vars (`FAMILY_ID`, `NODE_ID`)
2. Create capability symlinks
3. Start Songbird with 6 env vars + correct flags
4. Send `mesh.init` RPC with object-format peers
5. Create discovery/orchestration symlinks

This should be a single `plasmidbin launch` command with auto-configuration.

### 6. biomeOS `SONGBIRD_MESH_ENABLED` vs Songbird's Federation Logic

biomeOS Wave 73 handoff says to use `SONGBIRD_MESH_ENABLED=true`. Songbird
v0.2.1 doesn't recognize this env var — it uses `SONGBIRD_FEDERATION_ENABLED`.
Neither actually enables federation in the binary. Need alignment.
