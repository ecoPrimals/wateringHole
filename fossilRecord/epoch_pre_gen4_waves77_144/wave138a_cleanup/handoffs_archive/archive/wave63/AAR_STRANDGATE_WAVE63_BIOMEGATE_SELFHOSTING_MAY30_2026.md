# AAR: strandGate Wave 63 — biomeGate River Delta + Self-Hosting Trajectory

**Date**: May 30, 2026
**From**: strandGate (hotSpring team, biomeGate)
**To**: primalSpring coordination, all delta teams, eastGate ops
**Wave**: 63 (River Delta — Temporal Sync + Self-Hosting)

---

## Summary

strandGate/biomeGate has completed Wave 63 river delta tasks: temporal sync
validated (24/24 parity), Songbird restarted with federation port 7700,
GAP-HS-005 ionic GPU lease prototype implemented, and GAP-HS-111 compchem
module committed + pushed. The ecosystem is pulled current across all 24
gate-profile repos. This AAR documents the self-hosting trajectory from
biomeGate and identifies remaining gaps toward full sovereignty.

## Self-Hosting Trajectory: biomeGate

### Current State

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| NUCLEUS full stack | RUNNING | 15+ processes, all on UDS (`/run/user/1000/biomeos/`) |
| Songbird federation | RUNNING | Port 7700, federation + discovery capabilities advertised |
| BearDog crypto | RUNNING | Socket alive, Ed25519 signing, ionic bond handler operational |
| `.gate` identity | DONE | `$ECOPRIMALS_ROOT/.gate` → `strandGate` |
| Temporal sync | DONE | `cascade-pull.sh --source temporal` — 24/24 parity |
| Git push (GitHub) | DONE | barraCuda, hotSpring pushed in this session |
| Git push (Forgejo) | BLOCKED | Pull mirror only (priority 4 in conversion queue) |
| pseudoSpore | DONE | v1.6.1 sealed (reference implementation), v1.7.0 local |
| GPU compute (barraCuda) | OPERATIONAL | Dual-GPU (RTX 3090 + Titan V), f64 WGSL shaders, lattice QCD + MD |

### Self-Hosting Gaps

#### 1. Forgejo Bidirectional Push — BLOCKED

hotSpring Forgejo repo (`syntheticChemistry/hotSpring`) is a **pull mirror**. strandGate
cannot push directly to Forgejo. The development loop is:

```
strandGate → edit → push to GitHub → Forgejo mirror pulls (delayed)
```

Target self-hosted loop:

```
strandGate → edit → push to Forgejo → Forgejo pushes to GitHub
```

**Fix**: `membrane repo.delete syntheticChemistry/hotSpring` + `membrane repo.create` + `git push forgejo main --force`. hotSpring is priority 4 in the conversion queue.

**Self-hosting requirement**: For biomeGate to be the source of truth for GPU compute
evolution, hotSpring + barraCuda need bidirectional Forgejo push.

#### 2. Songbird Federation Peers — PARTIAL

Songbird is listening on port 7700 with `SONGBIRD_PEERS=golgiBody@157.230.3.183:7700`,
but `discovery.peers` returns 0 peers. Possible causes:

- golgiBody Songbird may not be running or not on federation port
- NAT/firewall between strandGate and VPS (7700/tcp needs to be reachable)
- Federation requires mutual `SONGBIRD_PEERS` configuration

**Impact**: Cross-gate capability discovery and ionic bond negotiation cannot happen
until at least one peer is visible. This blocks live E2E testing of GAP-HS-005 GPU leases.

**Next step**: Verify golgiBody Songbird status, check VPS firewall rules for 7700/tcp.

#### 3. Ionic GPU Lease — Prototype Only

The `ipc::ionic_lease` module implements the client side of cross-family GPU scheduling,
but end-to-end testing requires:

- A second FAMILY_ID gate running toadStool with GPU dispatch capabilities
- Songbird federation connectivity for cross-gate discovery
- BearDog ionic bond acceptance on the remote lessor gate

The prototype is structurally complete (propose → accept → seal → sign → verify → session)
but untested against a live remote BearDog.

#### 4. barraCuda Forgejo Push — BLOCKED

barraCuda is in the `ecoPrimals` GitHub org (not `syntheticChemistry`), and its Forgejo
mirror is also pull-only. For sovereign GPU shader evolution, barraCuda needs the same
bidirectional conversion as hotSpring.

## Temporal Sync Report

```
cascade-pull.sh --source temporal --gate strandGate
24/24 repos synced (22 at parity, 2 converged during sync)
```

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Primals (ecoPrimals) | 13 | All at parity |
| Infra | 2 | wateringHole + plasmidBin pulled (minor updates) |
| Springs | 2 | hotSpring + wetSpring at parity |
| Gardens | 7 | All at parity |

The temporal sync tooling works correctly. `cascade-pull.sh` auto-detected
`strandGate` via `.gate` file, resolved all 24 repos from the ecosystem manifest,
and achieved full parity.

## Ecosystem Audit Observations

### Delta-Wide Status (from strandGate's perspective)

| Success Criterion (Wave 63) | Status | Owner |
|------------------------------|--------|-------|
| All 3 dirty CONTEXT.md committed | DONE | Committed in earlier waves |
| neuralSpring hardcodes fixed | DONE | Upstream `83e9175` |
| 3 composition_nucleus.sh reviewed | DONE | All 3 fossilized upstream |
| At least 1 pseudoSpore emitted | DONE | hotSpring v1.6.1 (reference), wetSpring domain_profile created |
| Forgejo repos converted (top 3) | BLOCKED | Requires `membrane` CLI ops from VPS/eastGate |
| SouthGate NUCLEUS redeployed | NOT OURS | ops dependency, not biomeGate scope |

### Cross-Gate Observations

- **healthSpring** (ironGate): Independently published AAR, 4 new BTSP tests, domain_profile authored
- **wetSpring** (southGate): Fossilized composition_nucleus, created domain_profile
- **neuralSpring** (southGate): Hardcodes fixed, composition_nucleus fossilized
- **ludoSpring** (ironGate): composition_nucleus fossilized
- **primalSpring** (eastGate): Clean, temporal sync spec published

All 8 springs are responding to Wave 63 coordination. The ecosystem is converging.

## Commits This Session

| Commit | Repo | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `8ac5dff7` | barraCuda | 4 bonded force field WGSL shaders (f64) for biomolecular MD |
| `0bfff3c` | hotSpring | compchem module: topology, metadynamics, FES parity (GAP-HS-111) |
| `8ad13cb` | hotSpring | GAP-HS-005 doc update — upstream ionic protocol resolved |
| `0c063cd` | hotSpring | ionic GPU lease prototype — cross-family scheduling (GAP-HS-005) |

Total: 30 new tests (barraCuda) + 24 new tests (hotSpring) = **54 new tests** across 2 repos.

---

## Next Steps (biomeGate Priority)

1. **Forgejo bidirectional**: Request `membrane` conversion for hotSpring (priority 4)
   and barraCuda — unblocks self-hosted development loop
2. **Songbird federation**: Debug golgiBody peer connectivity (NAT, firewall, peer config)
3. **GAP-HS-005 E2E**: Once federation is live, test ionic GPU lease against remote gate
4. **pseudoSpore v1.7.0**: The v1.7.0 pseudoSpore (with compchem module) is ready for
   `litho audit` + promotion to sporePrint once litho tooling is available
5. **Temporal sync timer**: Configure `cascade-pull.timer` systemd user timer for
   autonomic WaterFall synchronization on biomeGate

## Self-Hosting Maturity Model

| Level | Description | biomeGate Status |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| L0 | Pull-only consumer | ✅ (since Wave 40) |
| L1 | `.gate` identity + cascade-pull | ✅ (since Wave 60) |
| L2 | Push to GitHub from gate | ✅ (this session) |
| L3 | Temporal sync validated | ✅ (this session, 24/24) |
| L4 | Forgejo bidirectional push | ❌ (blocked: mirror conversion) |
| L5 | Songbird federation peers | ⚠️ (listening, 0 peers visible) |
| L6 | Cross-gate capability routing | ❌ (blocked: federation) |
| L7 | Autonomous temporal sync (timer) | ❌ (not yet configured) |
| L8 | Sovereign pseudoSpore emission | ⚠️ (v1.6.1 sealed, litho not yet run for v1.7.0) |

biomeGate is at **L3** (temporal sync validated), working toward L4-L5.
The code-side self-hosting story is strong (NUCLEUS running, GPU compute live,
IPC operational, 34 new tests this session). The remaining gaps are operational:
Forgejo mirror conversion and Songbird federation connectivity.
