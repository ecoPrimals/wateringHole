## Why This Area Is Perfect for Community Mesh

1. **Flat terrain** — no hills to block RF. Every house can see its neighbors.
2. **Dense grid** — short lot widths (40-50ft) mean nodes are close together.
3. **Mature trees but low buildings** — 1-story and 1.5-story homes. Roof-mounted radios clear canopy.
4. **Underserved** — South Lansing is historically overlooked for infrastructure investment.
5. **Walkable scale** — entire area fits in a 1.6km x 1.1km rectangle. One radio covers multiple blocks.
6. **Community spirit** — Old Everett Neighborhood Association active. Garage sales, block parties.
7. **Low property values** — affordable for community buy-in. $20/month shared bandwidth model viable.
8. **Existing fiber** — ATT has fiber in the area (your drop proves it). Can be gateway bandwidth source.

## Mesh Architecture — Three Layers

### Layer 1: Backbone (High-Capacity Links)

```
            [SUPERNODE: 4422 Southgate]
            ATT Fiber → sporeGate → CRS310
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        │           │           │
   [sector W]  [sector S]  [sector E]
   covers       covers       covers
   Cedar side   Jolly side   Penn side
```

**Supernode** = your property (4422 Southgate, corner lot with ATT fiber).
High-power sector antennas on your roof cover the entire rectangle.

| Component | Hardware | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Supernode (gateway) | sporeGate + CRS310 (existing) | — |
| Sector antenna W | Ubiquiti LiteAP 5AC (120°) | Cedar to Samantha |
| Sector antenna S | Ubiquiti LiteAP 5AC (120°) | Southgate to Jolly |
| Sector antenna E | Ubiquiti LiteAP 5AC (120°) | Samantha to Penn |

A single elevated sector antenna (120° beam) at ~8m height (roof peak of 1.5-story house)
covers ~800m radius easily in flat terrain. Three sectors = full 360° coverage of the
entire Cavanaugh-Jolly-Cedar-Penn rectangle from ONE location.

Cost: ~$300-400 for 3 sector antennas. Covers 800-1200 households.

### Layer 2: Distribution (Block-Level Relays)

For houses that can't get clean line-of-sight to the supernode (behind trees, far corners):

```
[supernode] ──radio──► [relay node on Robert St]
                              │
                    ──radio──► [relay node on Spokane]
                                    │
                          ──radio──► [far corner near Jolly/Cedar]
```

Relay nodes = MikroTik SXTsq 5 ax ($65 each) on volunteer roofs.
Each relay:
- Receives from supernode or upstream relay
- Retransmits to downstream relays and local clients
- Powered by single PoE cable from indoor outlet

Relay spacing: every 2-3 blocks (~300-400m). Need 3-5 relays for full coverage.

### Layer 3: Last Mile (Client Connections)

Each household that joins gets:

| Option | Hardware | Cost | Speed |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **WiFi client** (line of sight to relay/sector) | MikroTik SXTsq 5 ax | $65 | 200-600 Mbps |
| **Window unit** (no roof access) | Ubiquiti NanoStation | $99 | 100-300 Mbps |
| **Indoor mesh** (very close to relay) | Standard WiFi router | $30 | 50-150 Mbps |
| **Wired** (adjacent to relay host) | Cat6a run | $25-50 | 2.5-10 Gbps |

## Coverage Map — From Your Roof

From the roof peak at 4422 Southgate (~8m height, corner lot = minimal obstruction):

    └─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘

    Your target rectangle (Cav→Jolly→Cedar→Penn) fits ENTIRELY
    within the radio coverage of a single elevated 5 GHz sector
    array on your roof. The whole neighborhood is ONE hop.
```

**The entire target area (1.6km x 1.1km) is within single-hop range of your roof.**
With 3 sector antennas you can serve the whole rectangle without any relays.
Relays only needed for houses with heavy tree obstruction or no line-of-sight.

## Budget Model

### Infrastructure (one-time)

| Item | Qty | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Sector antennas (roof) | 3 | $130 | $390 |
| Relay nodes | 5 | $65 | $325 |
| Mounting hardware | 8 | $25 | $200 |
| PoE switches (relay sites) | 5 | $40 | $200 |
| Cat6a outdoor (close neighbors) | 200m | $0.80/m | $160 |
| Weatherproof enclosures | 5 | $30 | $150 |
| **Infrastructure total** | | | **~$1,425** |

### Per-Household (client equipment)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| MikroTik SXTsq 5 ax | $65 | Mounted on exterior wall/windowsill |
| PoE injector | $15 | Included with some units |
| Cat6 patch (interior) | $10 | To their router/computer |
| Installation labor | $0-50 | Volunteer or paid |
| **Per household** | **$90-140** | One-time |

### Ongoing (monthly)

| Cost | Amount | Funded By |
|------|--------|-----------|
| ATT Fiber (1 Gbps symmetric) | ~$80/month | Split across users |
| Second fiber (redundancy) | ~$80/month | Optional, Phase 3+ |
| Electricity (radios) | ~$15/month | Negligible per household |
| Maintenance fund | ~$50/month | Savings for hardware replacement |

**At 50 households**: $80 fiber / 50 = $1.60/household/month for bandwidth.
Charge $15-20/month → covers fiber + maintenance + expansion fund.
**At 100 households**: Even cheaper per-user. Community self-sustaining.

## Comparison to ISP Options

| | ATT Fiber | Comcast | Community Mesh |
|--|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Monthly cost | $55-80 | $50-90 | $15-25 |
| Speed | 300-1000 Mbps | 100-1200 Mbps | 100-600 Mbps |
| Data caps | None | 1.2 TB | None |
| Contract | 1-2 years | 1-2 years | Month-to-month |
| Ownership | ATT | Comcast | Community |
| Local control | None | None | Full |
| Resilience | Single point of failure | Single point of failure | Mesh redundancy |
| Privacy | ISP logging | ISP logging | Sovereign (no logging) |
| Compute access | None | None | Distributed HPC included |

## What Makes This Different from NYC Mesh et al.

| NYC Mesh / Standard | Old Everett Sovereign Mesh |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Internet access only | Internet + distributed compute (HPC) |
| Generic routing | membrane primals on every node (13 services) |
| Volunteer-maintained | Autonomous (primals self-heal, self-update) |
| Central gateway dependency | Multi-path (fiber + cellular + P2P + WireGuard) |
| No identity layer | bearDog cryptographic identity per node |
| No sovereignty | Full sovereignty — community owns data path end-to-end |
| Passive infrastructure | Active infrastructure — nodes contribute CPU/RAM/storage |

Every household that joins gets:
1. **Internet access** (shared fiber, $15-25/month)
2. **Local network** (sub-1ms to neighbors — LAN gaming, file sharing, local services)
3. **Distributed compute** (their NUC contributes to and benefits from HPC cluster)
4. **Sovereign identity** (membrane primals, encrypted mesh, no ISP snooping)
5. **Resilience** (if ATT goes down, mesh reroutes via cellular or neighbor's ISP)

## Regulatory & Community Path

### FCC Compliance
- All 5 GHz equipment is Part 15 certified (unlicensed, no permits)
- Outdoor antennas: no restrictions for residential mounting under 6m (20ft)
- Point-to-point: unlimited range on unlicensed 5 GHz (with FCC-certified equipment)

### City of Lansing
- No franchise agreement needed (not reselling, community sharing)
- Low-voltage cable burial: no permit for residential (check MISS DIG 811)
- Antenna mounting: allowed on residential structures (no zoning variance needed)
- Potentially eligible for Michigan broadband equity grants

### Community Organization Options
1. **Informal sharing** (now) — neighbors split your fiber bill
2. **Unincorporated association** — handshake agreement, shared maintenance
3. **501(c)(3) nonprofit** — tax-exempt, eligible for grants (Newport Mesh model)
4. **Cooperative** — member-owned, democratic governance (People's Choice model)

### Pitch to City of Lansing
- "South Lansing has been overlooked for infrastructure investment"
- Community mesh provides affordable broadband to underserved area
- No city funding required (community self-funded)
- Reduces digital divide in historic neighborhood
- Model can replicate to other Lansing neighborhoods
- Compatible with (not competing against) ATT/Comcast — uses their fiber as backhaul

## Technical Stack (Per Node)

Every node in the mesh runs:
```
Hardware:  GMKtec NucBox or equivalent (Ryzen 5, 28GB RAM, 2.5G NIC)
OS:        Pop!_OS 22.04 / Ubuntu Server
Routing:   systemd-networkd + nftables (site routers only)
Identity:  membrane primals (bearDog, skunkBat, songBird, etc.)
Mesh:      WireGuard overlay (10.13.37.0/24)
Remote:    RustDesk (sovereign relay via golgiBody)
Compute:   Available CPU/RAM contributed to distributed HPC pool
```

Lighter nodes (just internet access, no compute contribution):
```
Hardware:  MikroTik SXTsq 5 ax ($65, bridges traffic)
OS:        RouterOS v7 (transparent bridge mode)
Role:      Relay only — extends coverage, no primals
```

| Month | Milestone | Households | Cost |
|-------|-----------|------------|------|
| 0 (now) | 2 houses proven (Southgate + Samantha) | 2 | $0 (existing) |
| 1-2 | Block ring (4-6 adjacent houses) | 6 | ~$800 |
| 3-4 | First sector antenna on roof | 15 | ~$1200 total |
| 5-6 | Full sector array (3 antennas) | 30 | ~$1800 total |
| 7-9 | Relay nodes on volunteer roofs | 50 | ~$2500 total |
| 10-12 | Community org formed, grant applications | 75 | ~$3000 total |
| 12-18 | Full rectangle coverage | 100+ | ~$5000 total |
| 18-24 | Expand beyond rectangle, second gateway | 200+ | Grant-funded |

**The entire Cavanaugh-Jolly-Cedar-Penn rectangle can be community-meshed
for under $5000 in infrastructure, serving 100+ households at $15-25/month.**
