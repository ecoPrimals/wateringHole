# sporeGate demotion — from edge router to compute node
# Run on: sporeGate DURING maintenance window
# When:   AFTER the ATT cable has been moved to Flint and Flint config is committed
#
# This script removes sporeGate's router duties:
#   - Stops dnsmasq (DHCP/DNS moves to Flint)
#   - Removes gateway IP (.1), keeps compute IP (.3)
#   - Sets default route through Flint (.1)
#   - Disables WAN interface (cable moved to Flint)
#   - Keeps: WireGuard, NUCLEUS, CI, RustDesk, Caddy
